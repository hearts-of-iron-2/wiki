Garrison Divisions (Gar) are second line troops used to safeguard valuable objectives far from the front lines. They lack heavy equipment and transportation, making them immobile except for strategic redeployment. They have limited fighting capability but can be used to free more capable troops for frontline use.

## Notes

- Garrison divisions are considered soft units.
- Garrison's have one job: Partisan Suppression.
- Using Garrison's for anything else is usually either a desperate act or a misuse of troops. Garrison's should be measured on one thing, their _Suppresion_ ability. Garrison '39 are the most cost effective at doing this. Unless you know that you are going to need Partisan Suppression, you don't need Garrison Divisions.
