This mod will give you the possibility to play as Imperial Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, etc in 1936, with the
main idea than WWI never happened. The turning point? Here again Serbia
is in the scenario- the Habsburg friendly Alexander I of Serbia was
never assasinated, thus empeaching the more radical Peter I to rise to
power, preventing terrorist movements to gain power, and by a domino
effect, the assasination of Franz-Ferdinand, the Great War, and all the
following crisis and events.

You may wonder: \'What is the point of playing with the 1914 borders?
There is already a WWI mod for HoI2.\' This mod will offer you something
different. It will be a mix of the (excellent) 1914 mod, and the
original 1936 campain. Alliances won\'t be the same cliché
France-Britain-Russia against Germany & Co. But i won\'t tell you much
now, I don\'t want to spoil your fun.

No major wars occured in Europe since the Franco Prussian war of 1871.
The old continent is dominating the world even more than in 1914, and
its economy is still ahead of America\'s, as no Great War or economical
crisis occured. But the massive industrial build-up of Europe came at a
cost, and the colonial empires are dependent of their colonies regarding
resources.
