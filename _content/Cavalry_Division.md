Cavalry Divisions (Cav) are able to move fairly rapidly over most types
of terrain and do not require a supply of fuel to operate, but they are
lightly armed when compared with Armoured units, and the automatic
weapons of the time can inflict devastating casualties to both men and
horses. That is not to say that Cavalry can't prove useful in some
instances as a mobile reserve.

##  Notes 

-   Cavalry divisions are considered a soft unit.
-   It is often considered that *Basic Cavalry* are a good place to stop
    for upgrading of units. Reasons include, cost effectiveness, Lack of
    Oil Consumption and the combat differences between *Basic Cavalry*
    and *Semi-Motorised Cavalry* being quite small.
-   Cavalry are often useful as disposable *raiders* . When an enemy
    front has been *holed* the Cav race through to attempt to either
    encircle the enemy troops or race to capture/deny resources, IC or
    Victory Points
-   Cavalry are classified in the category of
    [TECH_CAT_CAVALRY](/wiki/index.php?title=TECH_CAT_CAVALRY&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECH CAT CAVALRY (page does not exist)")
    and thus are affected by
    [Terrain](/wiki/index.php?title=Terrain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Terrain (page does not exist)")
    and [Weather](/wiki/Weather "Weather") differently to other land
    types
