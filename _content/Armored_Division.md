Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their
speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched
Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce
accordingly. They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in
the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would
be next to useless.
