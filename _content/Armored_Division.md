---

Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly. They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would be next to useless.
