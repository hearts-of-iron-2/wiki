tactical strikes against enemy surface vessels using torpedoes or
armour-piercing bombs. They have a limited dog-fighting capability,

##  Notes 

-   Sea detection was drastically reduced in Armageddon. Naval bombers
    now need ships to find their bombing targets. (Yes, this is
    unhistorical).
-   Still, naval bombers are so powerful, that many players consider
    using them an exploit.
