---
 Infantry will most likely make up the bulk of your army. They are relatively cheap to build and require no regular fuel supply to manoeuvre, but their lack of motorized transport means their speed of advance is limited. However, Infantry are able to occupy large areas of land, securing ground captured by other forces.
