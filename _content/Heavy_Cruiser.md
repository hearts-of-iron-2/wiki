Heavy Cruisers are larger and more heavily armored than their lighter
counterparts. They have larger main guns, giving them the ability to
bombard enemy units on land. They are effective against enemy surface
ships, especially destroyers and light cruisers, but are susceptible to
air and submarine attacks.
