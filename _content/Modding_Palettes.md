title: Modding_Palettes

This file is accurate as of version 1.2

Just a quick table for which palette files are attached to which
graphics. This is a work-in-progress; it is not complete.

In order for changes to take effect, the game must be quit and
restarted. Note that only 8-bit BMPs use the palette files. As a result
of this, there may be palette files that are associated with a graphic
file, but because the graphic file is 24-bit, the palette file is not
used.
