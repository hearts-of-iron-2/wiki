#  1936 

-   Sichuan had close to 300 000 regular troops and 600 000 militia
    (2.19)
    -   the central government only had 1 army and 1 division in the
        province

Organization The National forces are divided into:

-   13 route armies
-   49 armies

of varying strength. Some of the route armies contain as many as six
divisions, in addition to independent cavalry, artillery and other
units. The armies consist of one to five divisions. (6.425)

Distribution There were a number of changes in the distribution of the
National Army following the invasion of Hunan by Kwangtung and Kwangsi
units in June, 1936. The table in the XLS file was the approximate
distribution of China’s military forces in May-June 1936. (6.425)

Yunnan under Long Yun, Guangxi under Huang Xuchu, Guangdong under Li
Hanhun, Xikang under Liu Wenhui, and Shanxi under Yan Xishan, all beyond
the control of the central gov't (2.146)

##  February - April 

-   Feb-Apr, the Communists launched their "eastern expedition" into
    Shanxi, ostensibly to engage the Japanese in hebei and Rehe. As Liu
    Zhidan's army pushed towards Taiyuan, Yan Xishan sent a call for
    help to Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to demonstrating the CCP's
    determination to fight the Japanese, it recruited 8000 fresh troops
    and broke the back of Chiang's encirclement campaign which had been
    manned by a motley of 'mescellaneous' troops (3.109)
    -   also, leaders in NW China, including Zhang Xueliang were now
        convinced of the CCP's 'patriotic commitment'; consequently they
        lost their interest in fighting the Red Army.
    -   Zhang Xueliang and CCP concluded an unofficial non-aggression
        pact and called for unity against the Japanese
    -   Chiang assaulted the soviet area in April 1936, and Mao and Zhu
        De loosed a tirade of violent language against him. Chiang's
        assault was then called off
    -   As the Central government used this opportunity to try to assert
        its authority in the area, it scared Yan Xishan (3.205-206)
        -   Yan's armies were not effective and his rule was tolerated
            rather than actively supported
        -   He started a large "Force for the Promotion of Justice"
            campaign to rid his country of corruption and gain popular
            support
        -   by late summer, he was ready to actively with leftists and
            communists
        -   he tried to do this as a coutner to the Japanese and Chiang
            Kai-shek
        -   when the war broke out, there was no bar to the passage of
            the 3 main divisional commands of the CCP 8th Route Army
            across Shanxi
        -   organized 4 "Dare-to-die Columns" (Juesi Zongdui) each
            commanded by a party member who served simultaneously as a
            political officer in the 'New Army'

##  September 

-   Japanese take advantage of an incident similar to Luguojiao Incident
    (July 7, 1937), to take Fengtai, which is in between Beiping and
    Tianjin (3.116)
    -   later in the same year, they atempt in vain to purchase some
        1000 acres of land near Wanping for a barracks and an airfield.

&nbsp;

-   late 1936, secession-minded Mongol princes establish a regional
    govenrment claiming sovereignty over Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia,
    and launch an incursion into Suiyuan
    -   repelled by Fu Zuoyi, propelling the Chinese people into a
        nationalist furor

###    1st Group Army (Central Army *Zhongyang Jun* ) 

-   most powerful force
-   German trained (and later US equipped) divisions
-   led by Chiang
-   July 7, '37: 300 000 strong
-   eventually 350 000 men were added
-   had a central core of 80 000 which were equipped and organized to
    pre WW2 German standard and called the "Generalissimo's Own"
    -   had most of China's artillery, armore and equipment
    -   under direct command of Chiang

###  Guangxi Clique Army 

-   very powerful
-   12 divisions
-   highly trained regular army nucleus, and a large body of
    well-trained militia
-   since Guangxi has a good education system, a these soldiers were
    more literate than average
-   during the Sino-Japanese War, they expanded to 143 000 well-trained
    men
-   bore the brunt of numerous Japanese offensives

    Japanese standards, badly trained, poorly equipped and divided into
    numerous virtually independent and mutually jealous commands (3.126)

        -   barely half these units could be used for front line duties
        -   Nanjing had firm control over no more than 100 000 elite
            troops and an additional 200 000 troops of mediocre combat
            capability
        -   even at full strength, Chinese infantry had about 1/4 of the
            firepower of its Japanese counterpart
    -   while a Japanese division had 24 tanks, 266 trucks, 555
        horsedrawn vehicles, Chinese division had none.

    all description. At end of 1939, China had only 1 532 military
    vehicles (2.60)
-   Directives to launch the offensive were issued on November 19, 1939
    (2.57)
    -   Entire Chinese force was to be mobilized
    -   armies in 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 9th warzones were to constitute the
        main attacking force, with those in the other zones would mount
        supplementary attacks

        the Japanese at all
    -   commanders valued equipment more than soldiers, and adhered to
        the ultraconservative tactic of concentrating a large force to
        attack a fixed enemy position in explicit violation of the
        instruction of chinese high command
    -   most troops reluctant to move against the enemy unless they saw
        friendly units moving with them on both flanks

    Japanese Guandong Army in Manchuria, and from other units in Taiwan,

-   This surprise move routed a number of Chinese defense units and
    enabled the Japanese to capture Naning, the capital of Guangxi
    Clique. The Japanese plan was to capture Liuzhou, a railway center
    and from there to control the entire south and southwest of China
-   at Gunlong Pass, however, an entire Japanese brigade was destryed
    and the advance was stopped by a defense under the overall command
    of Bai Chongxi
-   the chinese force was 150 000 strong, with the addition of Guangxi
    guerrilla fighters
-   Japanese retreated after 10 months of futile occupation
-   later war records reveal that in 1937 the war in China engaged 16 of
    Japan's 24 divs and, after four years of the war, still with no end
    in sight, 27 Japanese divisions (out of a total of 51) were
    immobilized by the poorly equipped Chinese troops which often met
    defeat on the battlefield.

    -   Japanese reported that they completely destroyed 24 Chinese
        divisions, including most of the best GMD units
    -   Chinese confirmed that they lost about 200 000 men

#  1941 

Central Army (zhong yang jun)

-   30 divs (about 300,000 men) out of a total of 300 divs in entire
    nationalist army
-   by the end of the war, the Central army was about 650 000 men

&nbsp;

-   The Stalin-Matsuoka agreement freed Japan's crack Guandong army from
    the necessity of defending the borders of Manchuria (1.214)

##  January 

New Fourth Army Incident

##  April 

-   Chinese 1939 winter offensive grinds to a halt (2.58)
-   150 000 to 200 000 of the gov'ts best troops were diverted to
    blockade the communists (1.205)
-   Xibei San Ma forces conduct large-scale operations against the
    Chinese communists actics in the Gansu and Ningxia areas (1.206)

#  1942 

-   18th Army
    -   18th Division - regarded as one of the better units, but during
        1942 it was stationed in the rear and did not engage in comabt,
        6000 of its 11 000 men disappeared due to death or desertion

&nbsp;

-   Hu Zongnan commanded elite forces.

&nbsp;

-   Japanese estimated that the Chinese army numbered some 3 000 000
    men, of whom 40% (about 1 200 000) belonging to the Central
    Government (10)
    -   In turn, these Government forces comprise 650,000 troops under
        direct control and approximately 550,000 under subsidiary
        control.
    -   The strongest of all the local forces is the Szechwan Army, with
        about

320,000 soldiers.

-   -   the AVG, or the Flying Tigers, represented the core of Chinese
        air strength

Jianqiao airport at Hangzhou (1238) was used as an airbase at the
beginning of the war  
Japan also used an airbase in Taiwan during the war, but i don't know
exactly where it was.

Chinese Air Bases built in the middle of the war were:

    1260 - Changde
    1257 - Hengyang
    1250 - Ganzhou

Chinese Air Bases as of the latter half of the war:

    1280 - Chongqing

    1307 - Kunming
    1360 - Chengdu
    1276 - Lanzhou
    1231 - Xiangfan (Zhijiang, a strategic airbase)

-   Determined to seize the important Central Chinese dromes at Lishui,

Kanhsien, and Yushan, IGHQ on April 21 ordered General Hata, commanding
the China Expeditionary Army (10)

-   -   Taking part in the operation would be the bulk of the 13th
        Division

(HQ: Shanghai) in addition to a part of the 11th Division (HQ: Hankow).

-   -   The Thirteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Shigeru
        Sawada,

consisted primarily of thirty-four infantry battalions drawn from the
15th, 22d, 70th, and 116th divisions. On May 15, 1942, the bulk of this
Army launched a general attack against the Ninth and Eighty-eighth
armies of the Nationalists in the East Chekiang area. After the 19th of
May, both Chinese armies, which were fleeing along the Toyo River, were
shattered and put to rout. Chinhua fell on the 29th of the same month.

-   -   Twenty-six infantry battalions from the 3d and 34th divisions,
        etc.,

comprised the largest part of the Eleventh Army which, on May 81, went
over to the offensive and took Chinhsien (southeast of Nanchang) on June
2. Thus the Thirteenth and Eleventh armies were in a position to
pincer-attack the region along the Che-kiang rail line, from east and
from west. Both armies successively captured Linchuan, Chuhsien,
Chinjui, Chiangshan, and Yushan; they joined hands on July 1.

  

-   in March 1942, the Chinese gov't initiated a request to the American
    government to help equip and train 30 Chinese divisions (2.67)
    -   Stilwell took note of the fact that China's 300-odd divisions
        were prolly 40% understrength but that it would be
        self-defeating to try to reorganize them all at once.
    -   He argued that a few dependable well-equipped and well-supported
        divisions would be worth far more than the large number of them
        as presently organized
-   600 000 japanese fighting men tied up in China (1.213)

5th and 6th armies were key armies. China had called for the maintenance
of about 10 army corps, to be placed under the command of the national
military council and to be employed as a strategic reserve in vital
campaigns (1.213)

-   back bone of this force was the 5th and 6th armies, partly
    German-trained and German equipped
-   together with the 300 000 men (16 armies) under Hu Zongnan and Tang
    Enbo in the NW, these were prolly the best equipped forces Chiang
    had at his disposal
-   Japanese general HQ estimated the strength of this mobilizable force
    as 250 000 men
-   the 5th and 6th armies, before the Burma campaign served as
    Reserves, plugging up the most critical breaches in Chinese defenses
    as they occured

#  Burma Campaign 

After the Japanese DoW the USA, Chiang is prepared to protect the main
line of communication through Burma by sending a Chinese expeditionary
force, including the 5th (commanded by Du Yuming), 6th (commanded by Gan
Lichu) and 66th (commanded by Zhang Zhen) armies. (1.210,

-   66th corps composed of
    -   New 28th Division commanded by Kang Ze (Huangpu?) (?)
    -   New 38th Division commanded by Sun Liren
    -   New 29th Division commanded by a Huangpu (?) commander

Tai Anlan commands the Chinese 200th Division (1.212)

-   considered by the Americans as a man of "ability and force and
    considerable courage"
-   his division put up a 12 day defense of Toungoo against a superior
    Japanese force

Sun Liren commanded the Chinese 38th Division (1.212)

-   had the only allied victory of the First Burma Campaign

Japanese General Shojiro Iido outmaneuvered the allied forces and scored
a huge victory, sending them reeling back to India (1.2120

-   The allied forces, totalling 81 000 men, consisted of
    -   9 Chinese divisions under Lt. Gens Du Yuming and Gan Lichu
    -   5 Indian infantry brigades
    -   1 British armored brigade and 6 infantry Battalions under lt.
        Gen T.J. Hutton
    -   supportd by a Chinese-American Figher Group and several
        squadrons of the RAF

Stilwell wanted to reduce the Chinese army units to half the existing
number, and to construct 2 field armies, each to consist of 30 divisions
(1.213)

-   Liao Yaoxiang's New 6th Corps was recalled to China, so he left his
    50th division with Sun Liren

&nbsp;

-   Thus, at the beginning of 1943, the following armies belonged to the
    Burma Area Army, whose Commander was Lieutenant General Masakazu
    Kawabe: (10)
    -   Fifteenth Army: Commanded by Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi;
        -   nucleus consisted of 15th, 31st, and 33d Divisions.
    -   Twenty-eighth Army: Commanded by Lieutenant General Shozo
        Sakurai; order of battle issued on January 15, 1944;
        -   nucleus made up of 2d, 54th, and 55th Divisions.
    -   18th and 56th Divisions; 24th Independent Mixed Brigade.

##  Spring 1942 

training program for Chinese forces stuck in India. (1.184)

These Chinese forces were an expeditionary force consisting of the 22nd
and 36th divs. commanded by Sun Liren and Liao Yaoxiang

-   trained at Ramgarh
-   around these divs, Stilwell planned to build 30 Chinese divs

Source: [Responses to Sun
Liren](http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/sun/response.html)

-   New 1st Army, commanded by Zheng Dongguo, whom Stilwell didn't like.
    In spite of the fact that Sun Liren was only the deputy commander,
    he in actuality commanded the army. The New 1st Army consisted of:
    -   the New 30th Division, which was formed during the training at
        Ramgarh, it was commanded by Hu Su, and after the capture of
        Myitkyina, was commanded by Tang Shouzi
        -   the New 30th Division, because of this, was filled with new
            recruits, and so was used primarily as a reserve division.
    -   the New 38th Division, commanded now by General Li Hong
    -   the New 50th Division

&nbsp;

-   6th Army consisted of
    -   new 14th Division
    -   new 22nd Division

A similar force was trained in Yunnan (1.191)

-   commanded by General Wei Lihuang
-   100 000 men

  

#    Cairo Conference (1.214) 

-   Cairo Conference stated that China should put into action 30 divs
    initially, 30 more as soon as practicable, and 30 more eventually

#  1943 

(1.214) Japanese estimated that USAAF had only 130 planes in China, and
the Chinese had 200 planes

-   The Chongqing gov't decided to deploy loyal troops to check on
    regional troops as an insurance to make sure soldiers wouldn't
    defect to the Nanjing government (2.103)
    -   By 1943, this pttern had become obvious. Although the
        Sino-Japanese front changed little in these years, the location
        of the KMT's loyal units changed considerably.
        -   regional forces were spread out in all provinces
        -   troops from the same regional background were kept as far
            apart as possible
        -   whenever there were regional forces, there would be some
            central forces nearby
        -   the deployment of both regional and central forces no longer
            have a close and distinct relationship to the intensity of
            the Japanese threat

&nbsp;

-   With the aggravation in diplomatic relations between the Chungking

Nationalist regime and the French Government, the Chinese Air Force's
raids against Indo-China grew violent, from the beginning of 1943. Since
it was feared that the intensification in air raids meant the prelude to
Chinese Army penetration of the area, the Japanese Army High Command
decided to prepare operational measures against French Indo-China itself
(January 15, 1943). The gist of the plan follows. (10)

-   -   Have the Southern Army prepare to reinforce Japanese forces
        stationed in French Indo-China.
    -   Strengthen Franco-Japanese joint defenses.
    -   Proceed with preparations against the Kwangchow Wan sector.
    -   Have the China Expeditionary Army send about three infantry
        battalions to Hainan Island, and assume a wait-and-see policy
    -   On January 30, IGHQ ordered the China Expeditionary Army to
        reduce and occupy strategic points on the Luichow Peninsula, by
        a combined operation involving part of the army plus naval
        forces; and to penetrate the French Leased Territory of
        Kwangchow Wan.

##  August 

-   The defection rate of Natioanlist units to the Japanese puppet
    government in 1942-1943 was accelerated as Japanese troops turned
    their attention to pacification in the occupied area (2.101)
    -   by August 1943, a total of 600 000 Chinese troops, all from
        regional backgrounds, had defected to Wang Jingwei's government

##  November 

-   At Changde, Hunan, in November-December 1943, the 57th Division of
    the Central Army fought with extreme determination, suffing
    casualties of fully 90% (3.150)
-   In Western Hubei in 1943, against one of Japan's "Rice-Bowl"
    Campaigns, the Chinese lost some 70-80 000 men against 3-4000
    casualties for the Japanese

&nbsp;

-   Chinese Communists at Chongqing tell Americans that official figure
    of 18th Group Army and new 4th Army totalled 500 000 regulars, while
    guerillas counted for additional 2 million (2.128)
    -   number of regulars nearly doubled in next 15 months, until by
        spring 1945, Red army acquired military strength of 3 000 000,
        of which about 1 000 000 was regular force

#  1944 

(1.214) Japanese estimated that the allies had 500 planes in China

(1.217) Chennault wanted to bring his air strength in China up to a
total of 105 fighters plus 30 medium and 12 heavy bombers

-   requested that the maximum monthly supply load to come over the Hump
    was only 7000 tons
-   with this force he proposed to
    -   defeat the enemy air forces utterly in China
    -   cripple all Japanese rail and river communications in China
    -   sweep Japanese shiping off the China seas between French
        [Indochina](/wiki/Indochina "Indochina") and Korea
    -   commenced bombing the Japanese islands
-   although he did not even receive the minimum supplies for which he
    asked, he nevertheless succeeded in realizing the better part of
    these plans, with the exception of the bombing of Japan
-   achievements of Chennault's 14th Air Force were amazing:
    -   3 years fighting, it had lost (only from operational causes) 500
        aircraft
    -   destroyed 2600 Japanese aircraft, and 1500 "probables"
    -   sunk or damaged 2 500 000 tons of Japanese shipping, 44 naval
        vesels, 13 000 river boats under 100 tons

##  March 

Stilwell finishes building the X and Y Forces (1.215)

-   X-Force "Northern Combat Area Command" (commanded by Stilwell)
    Consists of
    -   New 1st Army (commanded by Sun Liren)
    -   New 6th Army (commanded by Liao Yaoxiang)
-   it's objective is to attack Burma from India

&nbsp;

-   Y-Force (commanded by Wei Lihuang)
    -   100 000 strong
-   attacks Burma from Yunnan
-   4 divisions set to cross the Salween? (
    [CMH](http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/sp1943-44/chapter19.htm)
    )

This is more than 200 000 troops together (1.219)

-   Japanese estimate of the total strength of China's effective
    strategic reserve for this year is 250 000 men

The X-Force had to fight trained junglefighters as the japanese 18th
division (1.215)

-   Together with Frank Merrill's Marauders (a pseudo-guerrilla force),
    the Allies killed or wounded over 75 000 Japanese troops and took 3
    023 prisoners

After much wrangling and foot-dragging, the Chinese gov't finally placed
6 elite central armies under General Stilwell's command and consented to
his plan to retake Burma (2.81)

-   -   by mid-July, 1944, when the japanese were compelled into a
        general retreat, their casualties had reached 85-90% for many
        units, and the dead numbered 72 000 out of a total force of
        about 100 000 men.

\(1\) Total casualties for China in 1944 were 311 276 officers and
soldiers

-   Japanese launch the Ichigo Offensive (1.219)
    -   Japanese allocated 70 000 horses, 12 000 vehicles to support a
        ground force of 400 000 men in the operation. (2.74)
    -   At this point, the Nationalists have a paper strength of 3 000
        000 soldiers in combat formation of 300 divisions (2.79)
    -   Chinese strategy was to send inferior troops tot he front and
        keep the elite units in the rear in order to attract enemy
        forces into penetrating deep and then releasing the elite units
        to annihilate the enemy in one blow
    -   Japanese stratgiests instructed troops to seek out the Chinese
        elite units first and destroy them. Once the Chinese elite units
        were broken, the rest would melt away

###  The Henan Phase 

-   employed some 620 000 first-line troops (1.219)
    -   April 18, Japanese opened the first stage with 140 000 men and
        crossed the Yellow River in central Henan (2.74)
    -   Chinese defense along the Yellow River consisted of 21
        divisions, of which only 11 were combat-worthy (2.74)
        -   most of the combat-worthy divisons were under Tang Enbo
            (2.74), who was in Northern Hunan to stop him (1.219)
        -   Faced with the need to defend a long line with such meager
            force, Chiang instructed that one division be assigned to
            defend a particular area (2.74)
        -   Before the attack, Tang Enbo had 28-30 divisions of the
            central government's best troops
    -   The Japanese used the 12th Army as the main attack force against
        Zhengzhou while sending their 1st Army to attack Luoyang from
        the west to confuse the Chinese (2.74)
        -   Taking advantage of the flat terrain, the Japanese relied
            heavily on tanks, long-range artillery, and mechanized units
            to spearhead their offensive
        -   Without air cover or sufficient ground support, the poorly
            trained and poorly equipped Chinese troops simply melted
            away
        -   Japanese took Luoyang on May 26
        -   between April 18 and May 26 the Japanese killed 21 463
            Chinese and a large number were wounded.
        -   Japanese losses were 1 061 killed and 2 866 wounded on their
            own
        -   less well-trained Chinese units from the 1st war zone were
            sent in as reinforcements
        -   between May 9 and May 20, some 43 490 Chinese were killed,
            while the japanese lost only 760 dead and 2 032 wounded

##  May 

###  The Hunan Phase 

-   The 1st and 12th Japanese Armies were shipped to central china, the
    13th Army was dispatched from Nanjing. (2.76)
    -   Additional units were drawn from Mongolia and Manchuria to
        reinforce the 11th and 23rd armies already poised in the staging
        area around Wuhan
    -   This force of 8 divisions and 1 brigade of 360 000 men
        represented the largest concentration of troops of the Japanese
        army in the entire history of the Sino-Wapanese War

&nbsp;

-   The Chinese defence in the 9th war zone under Xue Yue consisted of
    48 divisions, half of which belonged to the central government
    (2.76)
    -   Chinese had less than half a million men, a numerical advantage
        of less than 1.4:1 to the Japanese

&nbsp;

-   Japanese CiC in China was General Shunroku Hada (1.220)
    -   reinforced by the Guandong army in Manchuria, he threw 400 000
        troops into pincer drives from the north and south in against
        Changsha Operation Togo
    -   largest attacking armies ever assembled by the Japanese army for
        a single campaign during the entire Pacific war
    -   consisted of 25 divisions, 1 tank division, 11 mixed brigades, 1
        cavalry brigade, 1 air division, 12000 motor vehicles, 70 000
        horses
-   Changsha fell quickly (June 18), and next was Hengyang (2.77)
    -   Chongqing executed the commander of the Chinese 4th Army for
        failing to hold Changsha
-   the 16 275 Chinese defenders of Hengyang staved off three fierce
    attacks of 6 Japanese divisions, and assisted by the 14th air force,
    held the city for 47 days, but on August 8 they fell. (1.220)
    -   Hengyang was defended by the Nationalists' 10th Army under Fang
        Xianjue (2.77)
    -   Hengyang was not only a crucial point on the Hankou-Guangzhou
        railway, but also the site of the largest air base in Hunan
        (2.77)
    -   When the city finally fell, all but 1 200 of the defenders had
        been either killed or wounded. The Japanese also paid dearly: 19
        380 men and 910 officers were killed or wounded in the campaign
        (2.77)
-   entire Guangzhou-Hankou railway taken by beginning of 1945

##  June 

-   The Japanese destroy the backbone of the Chinese army with a
    powerful striking force of 1 tank and 3 infantry divs, together with
    a large number of mixed brigades (1.219)
-   in the assault the Japanese killed several Chinese divisional
    commanders, one group army commander, and a large number of men in
    the 30 divs commanded by General Tang Enbo
-   within 3 weeks the Japanese broke a Chinese force of 300 000 men

&nbsp;

-   At the conclusion of the Hunan campaign, Chinese casualties had
    reached such an alamring level, particularly among the elite units,
    that the government had trouble organizing for the defense of
    Guangxi. (2.78)

##  August 

-   strongest Japanese base at Myitkyina falls (1.215)
    -   all defenders annihilated

&nbsp;

-   In Operation Ichigo, the japanese were near exhaustion (2.78)
    -   7 602 Japanese dead, 13 174 wounded, 20 183 sick, 1 804 horses
        dead, 31 602 horses sick or wounded.
    -   500 000 Chinese soldiers dead or wounded (3.149)
    -   Fourth of China's factories were lost (3.149)
    -   In Guangxi, losses were reportedly 110 000 persons killed, 160
        000 wounded, 300 000 houses destroyed, 80 000 head of ploughing
        oxen killed (3.149)

##  September 

-   When Japanese advance units crossed into Guangxi on Sept 10., the
    Chinese finally scraped together only 10 divisions of 60 000-70 000
    men, mostly from the defeated units evacuated from Hunan, for the
    defense of Guilin (2.78)

&nbsp;

-   further reinforced by fresh units, the japanese pursed their drive
    westward along the Hunan-Guangxi railway. 16 out of 20 divisions
    were employed in the operations against Guilin, and the force was
    soon increased to a total of about 400 000 men (1.221)
    -   largest concentration of troops since the battle of Wuhan in
        1938

Guilin fell on November 10

-   -   in the first part of December, Japanese had taken Duyun and
        Guiyang

##  October 

-   Stilwell recalled to US in October 21, because of frictions with
    Chiang
    -   some time earlier, Stilwell categorically demanded that the
        Communist 18th group army be included under his yet to be
        created command. (2.128)

Wedemeyer orders General Fu Zuoyi to engage the Japanese in northern
China in order to prevent enemy reinforcement in the Guiyang area
(1.221)

-   flies in 23 000 fresh Chinese troops from the NW to stem the
    onrushing Japanese tide near Guizhou
    -   a part of these soldiers is the Liu Anqi Division of Hu
        Zongnan's army (
        [uglyChinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/war.htm) )
    -   Wedemeyer also flew two divisions of the X-Force to Kunming as a
        precaution (
        [uglyChinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/war.htm) )
-   500 000 unfit soldiers withdrawn from the front lines and sent for
    medical treatment

&nbsp;

-   Chinese commanders like Long Yun, Pan Wenhua and Yu Hanmou among
    others, agreed to put up no further resistance to the japanese and
    let them destroy Chiang Kai-Shek's armies (3.176)
    -   This is odd, because Yu Hanmou was firmly in the Whampoa Clique.

##  November 

proposal to reduce China's army from 327 divisions to 84 effective
combat divisions

-   wedemeyer suggested that the US train and equip 39 divisions and
    China the rest (1.193)

&nbsp;

-   late November, the 11th Japanese Army ignored the restraining order
    of the 6th Area Army and made a rapid thrust toward Guizhou
-   it was stopped in early december by Chongqing's own garrison units
    (2.79)

&nbsp;

-   in the Ichigo Offensive, the Chinese lost over 23 000 tons of
    weapons and ammunition, or the equivalent of the equipment for 40
    divisions (2.80)
    -   750 000 troops had been put out of action through casualties or
        the destruction of their units
    -   the loss of Hunan, a rich rice-producing province, together with
        other areas, had deprived the Chinese gov't of the capability to
        support about 500 000 troops
    -   China's own war records reported that over 310 000 casualties
        had been sustained. This was nearly twice the casualties of 1943
        and made 1944 the most costly year for the Chinese army in
        personnel loss since 1941, and possibly the most costly year in
        equipment loss since 1938.
    -   The central government and the regional units that were more
        enthusiastic and competent in fighting (i.e. the 4th army of
        Guangdong) were the most devastated.
    -   the only Chinese troops that escaped the wrath of Operation
        Ichigo were those stationed in China's northwest, including some
        central sdivisions under the command of Hu Zongnan.

&nbsp;

-   At the end of 1944, Japanese forces in China comprised the following

strength: (10)

-   -   25 infantry divisions
    -   1 tank division
    -   10 independent mixed brigades
    -   11 independent infantry brigades, etc.

&nbsp;

-   Between the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945, IGHQ felt that it
    must shift the emphasis of the China Expeditionary Army to the
    coastal regions of South and Central China. This constituted an
    epochal change: By ordering the China Expeditionary Army (which was
    engaged m campaigns to the west) to reverse its momentum, IGHQ was
    obliging that army to switch to preparations against the U. S.
    forces instead. (10)
    -   On January 22, 1945, IGHQ ordered the Commander-in-Chief of the
        China

Expeditionary Army (General Okamura) to: foil attempts by American
forces to advance into the Chinese Continent; secure strategic areas on
the Continent; and strive to eliminate the influence of Chungking.

-   As the first step, it was planned (by the spring or summer of 1945)
    to

increase the quantity of Japanese armed strength on China to: (10)

-   -   20 combat divisions
    -   20 security divisions
    -   6 special guard divisions (for use against the Chinese
        Communists)
    -   17 mixed brigades
    -   50 battalions (to guard lines of communication)

&nbsp;

-   From the beginning of February, an immediate start was made to
    organize

three combat divisions (the 131st through the 133d); 12 mixed brigades;
and seven independent guard units. The setup was completed in March (10)

-   Even after the commencement of operations on Okinawa, IGHQ expected
    that

the next landing site of the Americans would be either near Shanghai or
somewhere in the southern part of the Shantung Peninsula. On April 18
the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, General Okamura,
was ordered to transfer four divisions from southern China to the
above-mentioned localities; i.e., the 3d, 13th, 27th, and 34th
Divisions - the pick of the Japanese forces in China. (10)

-   After the Hunan-Kweilin campaign, the U. S. Air Force proceeded to

expand the air field facilities at: (10)

            Chechiang
            Chingchen            Hunan & Kweichow Provinces
            Kweiyang

            Chungking
            Chaotung             Szechwan Province
            Chengtu

            Laohokow
            Liangshan
            Ankang               Northwestern Provinces
            Sianfu
            Nancheng

            Kunming
            Yunnani
            Paoshan
            Luliang              Yunnan Province
            Chengkun
            Yangchie
            Tiencha

-   In order to wipe out the air base at Laohokow (northwest of Hankow),
    the

China Expeditionary Army commenced operations against Laohokow on March
11, using the main force of the Twelfth Army (built around the 110th and
115th Divisions, the 3d Tank Division, and the 4th Cavalry Brigade) plus
the 39th Division (from the Thirty-fourth Army). The campaign developed
favorably, on the whole, and the Twelfth Army was able to occupy
Laohokow completely on April 8.(10)

-   On April 15 the China Expeditionary Army initiated the Chihchiang

campaign, which involved the bulk of the Twentieth Army (47th and 116th
Divisions, plus 58th Independent Mixed Brigade). The purpose of the
drive was three-fold:

-   -   To destroy the cluster of air bases around Chihchiang (west of
        Hengyang);
    -   To assume the initiative in defeating the main body of the
        Chungking forces in the Hunan area; and
    -   To facilitate battle-front readjustment operations in western
        and southern China (as will be discussed later).
    -   the Twentieth Army pushed forward and engaged powerful

American-equipped Chungking troops were checked by intense enemy fire,
however, and suffered heavy losses. Finally, on May 9, the offensive had
to be given up.

-   -   IGHQ quickly pulled out the 39th, 59th, 63d, and 117th Divisions
        the

39th, 59th, 63d, and 117th Divisions plus the Thirty-fourth Army
Headquarters, from Central and North China to new stations in Manchuria
and Korea. To replace these forces, it was decided to evacuate occupied
zones along the Hunan-Kweilin and Canton-Hankow rail lines in Hunan,
Kwangsi, and Kiangsi provinces. In connection with the plans,
appropriate orders went out to China Expeditionary Army
Commander-in-Chief Okamura, on May 28.
