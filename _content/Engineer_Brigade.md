Effects
-------

*   Engineer Brigades add +20 to [River Crossing](/wiki/index.php?title=River_Crossing&action=edit&redlink=1 "River Crossing (page does not exist)") , thus reducing the combat penalty for attacking across a river by 20 (eg [INF](/wiki/index.php?title=INF&action=edit&redlink=1 "INF (page does not exist)") goes from -50 to -30)
*   When an Engineer Brigade is included in combat (i.e. Attacking) against an enemy province the damage to [Infrastructure](/wiki/index.php?title=Infrastructure&action=edit&redlink=1 "Infrastructure (page does not exist)") is increased.
*   Engineer Brigades are the only Brigade that provides a speed increase.

Division
--------

The following are the list of Divisions that can have Engineer Brigades attached, and some notes on thier effects.

*   [Armoured Division](/wiki/index.php?title=Armoured_Division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Armoured Division (page does not exist)") , Engineers are usually seen as only useful to Type I. as a speed increase.
*   [Light Armoured Division](/wiki/index.php?title=Light_Armoured_Division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Light Armoured Division (page does not exist)") , Engineers are rarely attached
*   [Cavalry Division](/wiki/Cavalry_Division "Cavalry Division") , Engineers are never attached. They never increase the speed CAV types and the other advantages are negligable or useless.
*   [HQ Division](/wiki/HQ_Division "HQ Division") , Engineers are never attached. They never increase the speed and the other advantages are negligable or useless.
*   [Infantry Division](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") , Engineers are most useful to Type I. to III. They remain slightly useful to all INF Types
*   [Motorized Division](/wiki/Motorized_Division "Motorized Division") , Engineers are rarely attached, the speed increase is negligable.
*   [Mechanized Division](/wiki/Mechanized_Division "Mechanized Division") , Engineers are rarely attached, the speed increase is negligable.
*   [Garrison Division](/wiki/Garrison_Division "Garrison Division") , UNKNOWN what effect.
*   [Mountain Division](/wiki/Mountain_Division "Mountain Division") , Engineers are useful for Type I. Mountain Divisions, as they increase their speed. They do not increase the speed for any other Mountain Division.
*   [Marine Division](/wiki/Marine_Division "Marine Division") , Engineers are rarely attached, there are usually better Brigades to attach. Speed being the not greatly useful to Marines

Notes
-----

The [Brigade Strategy Guide](/wiki/Brigade_Strategy_Guide "Brigade Strategy Guide") lists Engineer Brigades as useless. This guide is ment to be a little more expansive.

*   **Engineers** are percieved poorly, mainly due to thier high manpower cost (2.5), also [Toughness](/wiki/index.php?title=Toughness&action=edit&redlink=1 "Toughness (page does not exist)") and [Defensiveness](/wiki/index.php?title=Defensiveness&action=edit&redlink=1 "Defensiveness (page does not exist)") do little in combat.

An example being that four [Infantry Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") with Engineers cost the same in manpower as five [Infantry Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") . Five [Infantry Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") are generally seen as much more useful.
