##  Supply 

-   According to Japanese projections at the outbreak of war, about 1.8
    million tons of shipping would be lost to Allied attack in the first
    24 months of the war (2.71)
    -   Yet in 21 months, 3.8 million tons ahd actually been lost
    -   Allied aerial attacks accounted for only 24% of the loss, while
        submarine attacks accounted for 55% of the loss

&nbsp;

-   At the outbreak of war, Japan had a transport capability of about
    5.5 million tons. By the end of 1943, even after herculean efforts
    to build new ships, the capability was reduced to about 77% percent
    of prewar level (2.71-72)
    -   In 1943 alone, the reduction was 16%, with the worst obviously
        yet to come
    -   At the Imperial Conference in November 1941, it was estimated
        that the petroleum imports from Southeast Asia would rise
        steadily and that by 1944 they should supply 84% of her needs.
    -   In 1943, Japan was already forced to turn to synthetic fuel in
        the volume of 760 000 litres to make up for the shortfall
    -   By Feb 1944, the total oil tanker loss reached 111 000 tons
    -   The fuel shortage in turn severely affected the production of
        such critical items as steel, airplanes, general ornance,
        warships, merchant ships, and motor vehicles which all began to
        decline sharply after mid-1944.

##  Troop Deployment 

-   Japan maintained 600 000 troops in China proper and 500 000 troops
    in Southeast Asia at around 1943 (2.72)
