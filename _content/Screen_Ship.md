CLs and DDs, which are operating in the same battle with capital ships,
are called screens. They may not necessarily belong to the same task
force as the heavies, but they are currently involved in the same
battle. For example, an ASW group of 3 CLs and 6 DDs is present in the
same seazone as a group of 6 BBs and 6 CLs when an enemy fleet shows up
and engages both groups in combat. For purposes of the sea battle that
ensues, the group would be considered as having 6 capital ships and 15
screening vessels. This term is only important as it applies to
[positioning](/wiki/Positioning "Positioning") .
