###  Base Strike 

Base Strike is the longest and most powerful of the three tech trees. It
focuses on winning naval battles with the help of Carriers. It offers
the best CV and DD positioning by far, and the best CV strike
efficiency. It also has a convoy raiding bonus (although weaker than
SLI), and the convoy escort + ASW bonus (although slightly weaker than
FIB). The tree ends in 1947 (or 1952 of you consider the semi unrelated
amphibious bonus). It will always have the best CV and DD positioning
bonus. CVs are the key to naval victory, and therefore this doctrine
tree is the key to naval supremacy.

Note that even though Carriers receive snow, rain and misc bonuses, this
will not make them effective in bad weather. They are still sitting
ducks when it's snowing.
