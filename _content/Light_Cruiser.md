 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") Light Cruisers are little more than large destroyers. They are usually lightly armored to give good speed and range. They are normally used in an escort role for capital ships like battleships or carriers, granting protection mainly from enemy air attacks, but also from enemy submarines.
