##  Specific mods 

###  WWII 

####  [CORE](http://www.terranova.dk/) 

-   Current Version: 0.3.2
-   Last Update: November, 2007
-   Popularity: *over 10,000 posts*
-   Compatibility: [HOI2, DD,
    ARMA](/wiki/Abbreviations#H "Abbreviations")

CORE is the Community Open Resource Exchange. CORE aims to make Hearts
of Iron 2 a more historically accurate and involving game, through
expanded and more detailed tech trees, corresponding units, tech teams
and a large number of events, reflecting both historical actions and
possibilities. Both Industrial Capacity („IC‟) and resources for the
entire game have been revised to better reflect reality in the late
1930s. Other features include reserve divisions instead of militia (a
reserve unit is less mobile, and has less heavy weapons - such as
artillery. These units form the mainstay of the armies of the minor and
semi-industrialized countries), rares scarcity, SS recruitment, 1:1
naval ship representation and negative resource production (representing
civilian spoilage of energy and oil). The basic CORE installer includes
generic graphics for techs, tech teams, leaders, ministers and models
that have been updated to fit the latest release. There are also
optional packages to download with an even greater amount of graphics
available, such as country-specific model graphics.

####  [Total Realism Project](http://www.totalrealismproject.com/) 

-   Current Version: 0.9.3
-   Last Update: March, 2008
-   Popularity: *over 10,000 posts*
-   Compatibility: [HOI2, DD,
    ARMA](/wiki/Abbreviations#H "Abbreviations")

The TRP mod has a long history a thriving community, both on the Paradox

historical realism.

####  [Mod34](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/mod-34-revolutions.277121/) 

-   Current Version: 0.5,2
-   Last Update: June, 2008
-   Popularity: *1,000 - 5,000 posts*
-   Compatibility: [HOI2, DD,
    ARMA](/wiki/Abbreviations#H "Abbreviations")

This mod begins in October of 1934 and features a completely new
technology tree (without historical year), improved AI, new units,
events (over 6000 new events), and new countries (for example:Vatican
city and League of Nations). The technology tree in particular is very
unique, in that it allows players to focus on specialization, and forces
choices in research such as choosing the trade-off of having faster
armor with weaker guns, or better guns but slower armor. In this sense,
every nation is sure to field different units.

####  [DAIM](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/daim.298/) 

-   Current Version: (does not use versioning)
-   Last Update: April, 2007
-   Popularity: *1,000 - 5,000 posts*
-   Compatibility: [HOI2, DD,
    ARMA](/wiki/Abbreviations#H "Abbreviations")

DAIM stands for "Determined AI Modification" and is a mod that solely
focuses on improving the AI. This is accomplished by ensuring the AI
researches and builds the most effective units possible, rather than
wasting time building units that the game engine/AI is not capable of
using effectively. Specific focus was made to improve: Germany, Italy,
Japan, Great Britain, Soviet Union, U.S.A. and Nationalist China. DAIM
can be adapted to other mods, since it only changes a select few AI
files. [Further

####    [Fallout's Doomsday Forum](http://terranova.dk/viewforum.php?f=49) 

####    [Fallout's Doomsday Website](http://www.hoi2-fallout.com/) 

We would like to introduce you to: "Fallout's Doomsday Mod for Hearts of
Iron 2 DD:A".

Have you been thinking about reuniting USA as a nation long after the
world ended, leading your armies across radiated deserts to fight the
mutated monsters and raiders out there? Or maybe you have been dreaming
about conquering those weak humans while leading an army of powerful
Mutant warriors to victory in their endless wars? Or perhaps you want to
control the Enclave, the shadowy survivors of the pre-War US government
who fled to their offshore bases before the Bombs fell, using their high
tech science and sinister experiments to establish a new world order?

All those paths await you in a new mod that has been created as a
tribute for two best computer role playing games ever: Fallout 1 and
Fallout 2. Set in a post Apocalyptic world 167 years after the Bomb was
dropped, this is complete science fiction conversion to HOI2. Completely
new tech tree, units, resources, economy, and nation groups; all with
unique graphics. A completely new gaming experience for the best WW2
strategy game ever made: Hearts of Iron 2.

The mod is set in the Wastelands: the radioactive and windswept remnant
of what was once North America. Take control of one of the many groups
rising to power on top of the ashes and ruins of pre-War civilisation.
Build industries and infrastructure, research technologies, manage your
resources, conduct diplomacy with other nations, build and manage your
military forces to achieve dominance over the Wastelands.

####  [Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/kaiserreich-legacy-of-the-weltkrieg-global-alternate-history-mod-for-hoi2.223176/) 

Kaiserreich is a Global Alternate History Mod for HOI2. It poses the
question, what if the Central Powers had won the first world war. The
Mod has a [Forum](http://z11.invisionfree.com/Kaiserreich/) and a
[wiki](http://editthis.info/kaiserreich/Main_Page) .

####  [A.E.I.O.U.](http://www.abominus.de.vu) 

The end of the Great War brought with it the end of the age of
monarchies. In Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Serbia,
ruling houses were overthrown and new governments installed in their
place. But those new governments were not always stable and were
themselves subject to opposition, and in some cases rebellion.

How might history have been different if, in the defeated Central
Powers, the emperors had returned? Play A.E.I.O.U., a modification of
Hearts of Iron 2, and find out. Can you lead Austria to reclaim her lost
glory?.

##  Off-Site Modding Guides 

###    [Havard's HoI Hacking Haven](http://web.archive.org/web/20060514181431/http://hearts-of-iron.com/) 

This site was made originally for the first Hearts of Iron, but most of
the basics of modding that game carry on into the sequel. This site is
almost an essential must-bookmark for any modder, and the tables and
examples contained in the site are worth their weight in rare materials.

###    [Baylox' event syntax overview](http://web.telia.com/~u87538946/event_commands.htm) 

Overview of all event-triggers and -commands.

  

##  How to use mod-dir 

Create a subdirectory and place your files inside it (maintaining the
exact directory structure of HoI) and then launch the game via HoI2.exe
followed by the name of the directory containing your mods. For a more
detailed description see the [Moddir](/wiki/Moddir "Moddir") page.

##  MP moddir Still Broken 

Even with v1.2 the [Moddir](/wiki/Moddir "Moddir") feature is still
broken for multiplayer play. Thus if you try and play a mod in
multiplayer it will fail. The only work around is to modify the main
game itself. [vic:Mods and
