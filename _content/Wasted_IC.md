title: Wasted_IC
---
 Wasted [Industrial Capacity](/wiki/Industrial_Capacity "Industrial Capacity") represents the amount of IC you have allocated over the actual amounted needed for the [Production Slider](/wiki/Production_Slider "Production Slider") , [Reinforcements Slider](/wiki/index.php?title=Reinforcements_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Reinforcements Slider (page does not exist)") , and [Upgrades Slider](/wiki/index.php?title=Upgrades_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Upgrades Slider (page does not exist)") . For example, if your production queue requires 100 IC to run at full capacity, and you have allocated 103 IC with the Production Slider, you will have 3 Wasted IC.

Allocating amounts over that needed in the [Consumer Goods Slider](/wiki/Consumer_Goods_Slider "Consumer Goods Slider") and [Supplies Slider](/wiki/index.php?title=Supplies_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Supplies Slider (page does not exist)") results in gaining extra money or supplies. These IC are not considered wasted.

You may always see the amount of wasted IC you have at the upper right corner of the screen.
