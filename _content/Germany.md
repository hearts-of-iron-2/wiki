[TABLE]

**Germany** is a [major power](/wiki/Major_power "Major power") in
almost every scenario, and is the leader of the
[Axis](/wiki/Axis "Axis") powers. Germany is the most powerful of the
traditional Axis countries and is also the most commonly played.

##  Overview 

For strategic guidance for playing Germany, see the [Germany Strategy
Guide](/wiki/Germany_Strategy_Guide "Germany Strategy Guide") .

##  Territory 

Germany begins with a dominant territorial position in Central Europe.

-   **Capital:**
    [Berlin](/wiki/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&redlink=1 "Berlin (page does not exist)")

##  Resources 

Germany is strong in most resources with a couple of notable exceptions.

###  Natural resources 

Natural resources are plentiful, with sizeable surplus level of
[energy](/wiki/index.php?title=Energy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Energy (page does not exist)")
(from Germany's huge coal reserves).
[Oil](/wiki/index.php?title=Oil&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oil (page does not exist)")
is however almost non-existant, although during peacetime at least,
Germany should be able to trade for whatever she needs and maintain
growing stockpiles in all areas.

Due to Germany's hungry industrial base, [rare
materials](/wiki/index.php?title=Rare_material&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rare material (page does not exist)")
are in short supply despite production. Prolonged wars will eventually
starve the industry if trade can not be maintained for rares.

Germany has a large population which should be able to maintain most
military building strategies well into a war, but heavy casualties will
eventually drain her. Germany does well to build units which economize
on manpower as main combatants, as the need for infantry and garrisons
to fill in behind advances will require large amounts later.

Initial stockpiles are 1000
[energy](/wiki/index.php?title=Energy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Energy (page does not exist)")
, 1000
[metal](/wiki/index.php?title=Metal&action=edit&redlink=1 "Metal (page does not exist)")
, 500 [rare
material](/wiki/index.php?title=Rare_material&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rare material (page does not exist)")
, 500
[oil](/wiki/index.php?title=Oil&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oil (page does not exist)")
, 500
[supplies](/wiki/index.php?title=Supplies&action=edit&redlink=1 "Supplies (page does not exist)")
, 70 [money](/wiki/Money "Money") , and 850
[manpower](/wiki/index.php?title=Manpower&action=edit&redlink=1 "Manpower (page does not exist)")

###  Industry 

Germany has a powerful industrial base, although it is concentrated in a
few vulnerable areas of the country. Once Germany expands beyond her
borders these will be harder for enemies to target, but will still need
to be protected against strategic attack. As long as it is well fed,
Germany's industry should be able to maintain healthy production of
supplies and new units to support offensives, but if it falters, Germany
will feel the pinch quickly. A side benefit is the large [transportation
capacity](/wiki/index.php?title=Transportation_capacity&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transportation capacity (page does not exist)")
resulting from her [IC](/wiki/IC "IC") level, although this will be
necessary once Germany's empire expands and occupation of territory
bleeds the [TC](/wiki/TC "TC") level.

###  Infrastructure 

Germany's basic infrastructure is superb, at 100% over nearly her entire
territory (only
[Oppeln](/wiki/index.php?title=Oppeln&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oppeln (page does not exist)")
is at 80%). This allows rapid movement between east and west front.

Airbases are maintained throughout the country, although the number of
full size airbases leaves room for growth. Besides Berlin,
[Breslau](/wiki/index.php?title=Breslau&action=edit&redlink=1 "Breslau (page does not exist)")
and
[Konigsberg](/wiki/index.php?title=Konigsberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Konigsberg (page does not exist)")
are the only two airbases in the east, although both are level 10.
[Kassel](/wiki/index.php?title=Kassel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kassel (page does not exist)")
and
[Munich](/wiki/index.php?title=Munich&action=edit&redlink=1 "Munich (page does not exist)")
are the only two other full size airbases. Six level 4 bases exist, with
[Rostock](/wiki/index.php?title=Rostock&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rostock (page does not exist)")
,
[Kiel](/wiki/index.php?title=Kiel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kiel (page does not exist)")
, and
[Wilhelmshafen](/wiki/index.php?title=Wilhelmshafen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wilhelmshafen (page does not exist)")
covering the north while
[Essen](/wiki/index.php?title=Essen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Essen (page does not exist)")
,
[Frankfurt-am-Main](/wiki/index.php?title=Frankfurt-am-Main&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frankfurt-am-Main (page does not exist)")
, and
[Stuttgart](/wiki/index.php?title=Stuttgart&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stuttgart (page does not exist)")
watch the west. Germany can look forward to peaceful acquisition of
[Vienna](/wiki/index.php?title=Vienna&action=edit&redlink=1 "Vienna (page does not exist)")
, a level 10 airbase, as well as
[Innsbruck](/wiki/index.php?title=Innsbruck&action=edit&redlink=1 "Innsbruck (page does not exist)")
(level 4),
[Prague](/wiki/index.php?title=Prague&action=edit&redlink=1 "Prague (page does not exist)")
(level 3) and
[Memel](/wiki/index.php?title=Memel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Memel (page does not exist)")
(level 1).

Naval facilities are quite good for such limited coastline, with two
full size ports facing the [North
Sea](/wiki/index.php?title=North_Sea&action=edit&redlink=1 "North Sea (page does not exist)")
at
[Kiel](/wiki/index.php?title=Kiel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kiel (page does not exist)")
and
[Wilhelmshaven](/wiki/index.php?title=Wilhelmshaven&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wilhelmshaven (page does not exist)")
, and two further full size harbors at
[Rostock](/wiki/index.php?title=Rostock&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rostock (page does not exist)")
and
[Konigsberg](/wiki/index.php?title=Konigsberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Konigsberg (page does not exist)")
on the [Baltic
Sea](/wiki/index.php?title=Baltic_Sea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Baltic Sea (page does not exist)")
.

##  Military 

Germany has a capable military in 1936. It is only of moderate size,
with little advanced equipment, but all infantry are to current
standard, and organization levels are very high for the period. The navy
is incapable of substantial operations at this stage, but the air force
is ready to begin supporting the army.

###  Static defenses 

German static defenses are inadequate to provide much help against
ground or air units. Germany should be on the offensive however, so the
weak ground fortifications won't be greatly needed. The West Wall gives
Germany a level one land fort in
[Aachen](/wiki/index.php?title=Aachen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aachen (page does not exist)")
,
[Cologne](/wiki/index.php?title=Cologne&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cologne (page does not exist)")
,
[Saarbrucken](/wiki/index.php?title=Saarbrucken&action=edit&redlink=1 "Saarbrucken (page does not exist)")
,
[Stuttgart](/wiki/index.php?title=Stuttgart&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stuttgart (page does not exist)")
, and
[Freiburg](/wiki/index.php?title=Freiburg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Freiburg (page does not exist)")
. This won't stop anyone, but for the thin line left to face France
while German forces mount attacks elsewhere, it is at least some help.

Antiaircraft defenses are scattered throughout the country, with more to
the west. These will need to be beefed up if the Allies begin any kind
of strategic air campaign. Major flak centers are
[Konigsberg](/wiki/index.php?title=Konigsberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Konigsberg (page does not exist)")
(4),
[Essen](/wiki/index.php?title=Essen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Essen (page does not exist)")
(3), and
[Frankfurt-am-Main](/wiki/index.php?title=Frankfurt-am-Main&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frankfurt-am-Main (page does not exist)")
(3). Smaller flak nests (level 2) are stationed in
[Berlin](/wiki/index.php?title=Berlin&action=edit&redlink=1 "Berlin (page does not exist)")
,
[Munich](/wiki/index.php?title=Munich&action=edit&redlink=1 "Munich (page does not exist)")

, and
[Wilhelmshafen](/wiki/index.php?title=Wilhelmshafen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wilhelmshafen (page does not exist)")
. Level one defenses are found in
[Kiel](/wiki/index.php?title=Kiel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kiel (page does not exist)")
,
[Lubeck](/wiki/index.php?title=Lubeck&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lubeck (page does not exist)")

, and
[Nuremburg](/wiki/index.php?title=Nuremburg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nuremburg (page does not exist)")
.

###  Army 

Germany's army is of moderate size (#8 in the world), but very good
quality. The heart of the army is its infantry, with 36 divisions (#3 in
the world) of
[infantry](/wiki/index.php?title=Infantry_36&action=edit&redlink=1 "Infantry 36 (page does not exist)")
divided amongst a dozen corps spread through the country. These are
bolstered by a mix of brigades (4 [artillery
brigades](/wiki/Artillery_brigade "Artillery brigade") , 3 [antitank
brigades](/wiki/index.php?title=Antitank_brigade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Antitank brigade (page does not exist)")
, 2 [engineer
brigades](/wiki/index.php?title=Engineer_brigade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Engineer brigade (page does not exist)")
and an [antiaircraft
brigade](/wiki/index.php?title=Antiaircraft_brigade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Antiaircraft brigade (page does not exist)")
). while Germany's industry provides a strong engine for steady growth,
high organization levels give German units good capabilities early.

Germany's armored force is small but not bad compared to some
competitors (#3 in the world). Its three [type I light
divisions](/wiki/index.php?title=Light_armor_division_I&action=edit&redlink=1 "Light armor division I (page does not exist)")
are not very capable in 1936, but are the basis for Germany's future
panzer juggernauts, and should be gaining experience, as they can be
upgraded to regular armor later.

A single headquarters ( [type
I](/wiki/index.php?title=Headquarters_I&action=edit&redlink=1 "Headquarters I (page does not exist)")
) is located in Berlin to begin with in 1936, and Germany will
undoubtedly need more.

Germany has a strong stable of land commanders to begin with. See
[Generals of
Germany](/wiki/index.php?title=Generals_of_Germany&action=edit&redlink=1 "Generals of Germany (page does not exist)")
for more info.

###  Air Force 

Germany's air force is designed for tactical support of the land forces.
Thus it begins 1936 with a force of 8 [tactical
bomber](/wiki/index.php?title=Tactical_bomber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tactical bomber (page does not exist)")
units and 3 [interceptors](/wiki/Interceptor "Interceptor") for the job.
All of these units are type I, but both types may be upgraded
immediately.

###  Navy 

Germany's navy is of limited combat value outside of the Baltic Sea. It
is led by two [battlecruisers](/wiki/Battlecruiser "Battlecruiser") ,
but both are Great War vintage, as are the three
[destroyer](/wiki/Destroyer "Destroyer") flotillas that accompany them
in the Baltic Fleet. A more modern cruiser force is at hand, with two
[improved heavy cruisers](/wiki/Heavy_Cruiser "Heavy Cruiser") and an
[improved light cruiser](/wiki/Light_Cruiser "Light Cruiser") in the
fleet as well as four basic light cruisers. One early light cruiser and
a flotilla of early destroyers round out the surface fleet.

Germany also has the seeds of a [submarine](/wiki/Submarine "Submarine")
force, although the boats it begins with are limited. Two short-range
flotillas and a single dive boat flotilla are in service to begin with.

Underway production will add another improved heavy cruiser, an early
destroyer flotilla, and a short-range submarine flotilla to the fleet
within the first three months of 1936.

##  Technology 

Germany has some strengths technologically, and has great research teams
to give it the edge in other areas. The money to pay for the teams
should be available in most circumstances as long as things don't turn
to badly against Germany.

Germany's infantry tech is moderately advanced, with the [early infantry
division](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_infantry_division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early infantry division (page does not exist)")
and [semi-motorized cavalry
division](/wiki/index.php?title=Semi-motorized_cavalry_division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Semi-motorized cavalry division (page does not exist)")
already discovered. Logistics are ahead of the game with [rear area
supply
dumps](/wiki/index.php?title=Rear_area_supply_dumps&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rear area supply dumps (page does not exist)")
and Germany has also the ability to build [early mountain
divisions](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_mountain_division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early mountain division (page does not exist)")
. Germany is poised to develop the [basic motorized
division](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_motorized_division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic motorized division (page does not exist)")
and [early marine
division](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_marine_division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early marine division (page does not exist)")
.

Germany is at a basic level in armor tech, possessing the [early
tank](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_tank&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early tank (page does not exist)")
, but ready to develop the [basic light
tank](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_light_tank&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic light tank (page does not exist)")
, [basic heavy
tank](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_heavy_tank&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic heavy tank (page does not exist)")
, and [early tank
destroyer](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_tank_destroyer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early tank destroyer (page does not exist)")
. [Early field
artillery](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_field_artillery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early field artillery (page does not exist)")
is in service, as are [early antitank
artillery](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_antitank_artillery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early antitank artillery (page does not exist)")
and [early static antiaircraft
artillery](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_static_antiaircraft_artillery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early static antiaircraft artillery (page does not exist)")
. Germany also has the capacity for [basic antiaircraft
brigades](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_antiaircraft_brigade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic antiaircraft brigade (page does not exist)")
and [basic armored
cars](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_armored_car&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic armored car (page does not exist)")
.

Germany has an advanced level of naval technology in surface combatants,
already possessing improved technology for the [light
cruisers](/wiki/index.php?title=Light_cruiser&action=edit&redlink=1 "Light cruiser (page does not exist)")
, [heavy
cruisers](/wiki/index.php?title=Heavy_cruiser&action=edit&redlink=1 "Heavy cruiser (page does not exist)")
, [battlecruisers](/wiki/Battlecruiser "Battlecruiser") , and
[battleships](/wiki/Battleship "Battleship") . She is on par with the
[medium range
submarine](/wiki/index.php?title=Medium_range_submarine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Medium range submarine (page does not exist)")
, but lags with only an [early
destroyer](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_destroyer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early destroyer (page does not exist)")
and [Great War aircraft
carrier](/wiki/index.php?title=Great_War_aircraft_carrier&action=edit&redlink=1 "Great War aircraft carrier (page does not exist)")
design.

Germany has a balanced contemporary aircraft technology, with both
[early
bombers](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_bomber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early bomber (page does not exist)")
and [early
fighters](/wiki/index.php?title=Early_fighter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Early fighter (page does not exist)")
available, as well as a [basic air
transport](/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_air_transport&action=edit&redlink=1 "Basic air transport (page does not exist)")
design. Germany can branch out in any direction desired for aviation.

Industrial technology in Germany is well-rounded, with mechanized
[agriculture](/wiki/index.php?title=Agriculture&action=edit&redlink=1 "Agriculture (page does not exist)")
, [census
tabulating](/wiki/index.php?title=Census_tabulating&action=edit&redlink=1 "Census tabulating (page does not exist)")
, basic [oil
refining](/wiki/index.php?title=Oil_refining&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oil refining (page does not exist)")
, and improved [construction
engineering](/wiki/index.php?title=Construction_engineering&action=edit&redlink=1 "Construction engineering (page does not exist)")
. She lags however, needing basic [machine
tools](/wiki/index.php?title=Machine_tools&action=edit&redlink=1 "Machine tools (page does not exist)")
. Advanced sciences are poised for development, as Germany has both a
faculty for [nuclear
research](/wiki/index.php?title=Nuclear_research&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nuclear research (page does not exist)")
and a [rocket test and research
facility](/wiki/index.php?title=Rocket_test_and_research_facility&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rocket test and research facility (page does not exist)")
capability.

German operational doctrines are very well advanced for all branches,
compared to other nations, giving Germany a strong early advantage.
German [land
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Land_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Land doctrine (page does not exist)")
is well advanced along the [spearhead
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Spearhead_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Spearhead doctrine (page does not exist)")
, with [delay
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Delay_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Delay doctrine (page does not exist)")
, [elastic defense
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Elastic_defense_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elastic defense doctrine (page does not exist)")
, and [schwerpunkt
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Schwerpunkt_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Schwerpunkt doctrine (page does not exist)")
all developed. [Naval
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Naval_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naval doctrine (page does not exist)")
is also well advanced along the lines of [sealane interdiction
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Sealane_interdiction_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sealane interdiction doctrine (page does not exist)")
, with [raider patrol
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Raider_patrol_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Raider patrol doctrine (page does not exist)")
and [unrestricted submarine warfare
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Unrestricted_submarine_warfare_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Unrestricted submarine warfare doctrine (page does not exist)")
developed. [Air
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Air_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Air doctrine (page does not exist)")
has been developed along the lines of [battlefield
destruction](/wiki/index.php?title=Battlefield_destruction&action=edit&redlink=1 "Battlefield destruction (page does not exist)")
and [operational
destruction](/wiki/index.php?title=Operational_destruction&action=edit&redlink=1 "Operational destruction (page does not exist)")
, with [dive bombing
doctrine](/wiki/index.php?title=Dive_bombing_doctrine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dive bombing doctrine (page does not exist)")
developed as well.

Germany](/wiki/index.php?title=Research_teams_of_Germany&action=edit&redlink=1 "Research teams of Germany (page does not exist)")

##  Diplomacy 

Germany is not in a strong position diplomatically. As leader of the
[Axis](/wiki/Axis "Axis") , she is currently alone, with even
like-minded nations such as [Italy](/wiki/Italy "Italy") not wanting to
ally. Meanwhile, most of her actions will sour relations with the
western powers and possibly the Soviets as well if she is not careful.
Germany has only minor diplomatic agreements in place in 1936:

-   **[Non-agression
    pacts](/wiki/index.php?title=Non-agression_pact&action=edit&redlink=1 "Non-agression pact (page does not exist)")**

    -   [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") : 8 energy for 4 metal

##  Domestic 

Germany begins with a mixed bag of leaders, but with its political
sliders set for hawkish authoritarian rule.

The [head of
state](/wiki/index.php?title=Head_of_state&action=edit&redlink=1 "Head of state (page does not exist)")
is [Adolf
Hitler](/wiki/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&action=edit&redlink=1 "Adolf Hitler (page does not exist)")
, a [power-hungry
demagogue](/wiki/index.php?title=Power-hungry_demagogue&action=edit&redlink=1 "Power-hungry demagogue (page does not exist)")
. He is able to assuage the western powers as long as all out war
doesn't break out, and will help gather the likes of Italy and Hungary
into the Axis alliance. [Head of
government](/wiki/index.php?title=Head_of_government&action=edit&redlink=1 "Head of government (page does not exist)")
[Rudolf
Hess](/wiki/index.php?title=Rudolf_Hess&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rudolf Hess (page does not exist)")
, a [silent
workhorse](/wiki/index.php?title=Silent_workhorse&action=edit&redlink=1 "Silent workhorse (page does not exist)")
, is nice for the IC bonus, but makes diplomacy a good bit more
expensive.

[Foreign
minister](/wiki/index.php?title=Foreign_minister&action=edit&redlink=1 "Foreign minister (page does not exist)")
[Constantin von
Neurath](/wiki/index.php?title=Constantin_von_Neurath&action=edit&redlink=1 "Constantin von Neurath (page does not exist)")
, a [great
compromiser](/wiki/index.php?title=Great_compromiser&action=edit&redlink=1 "Great compromiser (page does not exist)")
, is not very helpful early on, as Germany will have few allies to
cajole, and has little need for independence guarantees. [Armaments
minister](/wiki/index.php?title=Armaments_minister&action=edit&redlink=1 "Armaments minister (page does not exist)")
[Werner von
Blomberg](/wiki/index.php?title=Werner_von_Blomberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Werner von Blomberg (page does not exist)")
is an infantry proponent, and good to have while advancing infantry
tech. [Rudolf
Hess](/wiki/index.php?title=Rudolf_Hess&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rudolf Hess (page does not exist)")
will only help if building a strategic bomber force, so is unlikely to
be a good choice. [Administrative
genius](/wiki/index.php?title=Administrative_genius&action=edit&redlink=1 "Administrative genius (page does not exist)")
[Hjalmar
Schacht](/wiki/index.php?title=Hjalmar_Schacht&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hjalmar Schacht (page does not exist)")
will give a big IC bonus, but three [resource
