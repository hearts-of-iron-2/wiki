##  Background 

World War 2 is not a good period for Poland. Since it is the first to
fight, it is also the first to fall. Fortunately Hearts of Iron 2 is a
game that allows you to change the history and allows Poland a chance to
fight back and even annex Germany. However it is not for the faint
hearted and inexperienced player.

Do not bother playing Poland if:

-   Germany is human controlled.
-   You are new to this game.

##  Tricks 

###  Make Friends and Influence Countries 

You generally have extra energy. While some can be traded for other
important resources, make trades where you give energy away, but don't
receive anything in return. This tends to increase your relations by the
amount of energy per month, and is generally better than spending the
100 cash to increase relations.

###  Demand Territory 

One thing that Poland needs a lot of is money. For the first month, do
not build or research anything, but instead put all but the minimum for
supplies into consumer goods to increase your cash. Demand Territory
from the Soviet Union. Even on Very Hard/Furious they are likely to
cave, and you now have extra resources and the extra factories to get
that third tech slot.

Note: Because the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact events were never written for
this, this turns out to be an exploit as eastern Poland is seceded to
the Soviet Union, but not the provinces the Soviet Union seceded to
Poland. The Polish capital moves to Minsk, and this causes all sorts of
problems for Germany and the Soviet Union later on.

###  Early Alliance and an Overseas Haven 

Make trade deals to accumulate a huge surplus in all resources as well
as cash.

To get in the allies early, use your cash sparingly to influence the
United Kingdom and France. They will also influence you, adjusting your
social sliders and increasing your relations with them. An early
alliance means a large pool of blueprints and good trade deals.

Your new ally France has a useless province in South America called
Cayenne. It has no industry or resources, but has two victory points.
They may sell it to you for 5,000 each of energy, metal, rares, oil, and
cash. Your priority would be to industrialize this as much as you can
before war breaks out.

You now have a place for a government-in-exile.

Since Poland never truly falls, the Finnish Winter War never fires, and
the Soviets never demand the Baltics.

This can lead to a dull game. The German AI is not programmed to
properly fight on until Poland has fallen. Likewise, the Soviet Union
will often be unable to advance on for the same reason.

###  Fortress Warsaw 

Due to AI's inability to calculate the likely result for battles in
urban provinces, it almost never attack an urban province with enough
troops in it. You can exploit this weakness and easily stay alive with
Poland virtually forever, even if you start in 1939 scenario.

When the game starts, move all of your air and land divisions to Warsaw.
Make sure to adjust your production slider since you will lose a lot of
territory. After all of the armies arrived in Warsaw, you only need to
watch as the absent minded AI stacks a lot of troops around Warsaw but
never try to invade it.

###  The Polish Congo 

In 1936 scenario, it is relatively easy for the Polish to win a war
against a minor European nation with a colonial empire (e.g. Belgium).

Moving your [domestic
policy](/wiki/Domestic_Policy_FAQ "Domestic Policy FAQ") sliders to
Political Right will make you a Fascist nation in two years, meaning you
are able to launch unprovoked attacks with much greater ease. Produce a
[transport fleet](/wiki/Transport_fleet "Transport fleet") and load up
with troops.

In 1937, Declare War on Belgium. You can relatively easily conquer
mainland Belgium. As part of the peace settlement, insist on some
provinces in Africa that have victory-point value. When Germany
eventually conquers Polish mainland, they will be unable to annex you
because of your holdings in Congo.

The main disadvantage with this approach is that it is likely that
anyone guaranteeing Belgium will DOW on Poland. This is likely to be
BOTH France and Germany, virtually assuring Polish defeat. The key to
this strategy is therefore speed. Conquer Belgium before the
non-aggression treaties expire.

###  Polish Ireland 

When beginning the Road To War, quickly build up transports and base
about 2 infantry units and 5 militias. Quickly declare war on the irish.
Land in and push the enemy away from Dublin.

Once the enemy is separated you push inward and control the poor little
nation. As your new colony, Ireland has points of attack toward Brest.
It is a great base if Belgium joins the allies and your troops are
getting beat out in the mother land.

Once Ireland is captured, you have a base in Dublin to defend from being
annexed. (once captured, build up a navy and base them in Dublin. Try to
created militias and garrisons from left over production.

Likewise, the United Kingdom is highly likely to DOW over Ireland.
Again, speed is essential.

##  Walkthrough for 1936 Scenario 

###  Peace Time 

In the first year it is very important to build three factories. Build
one each in Torun, Danzig and Warsaw. After they are built, you will get
the third [research slot](/wiki/Research_Slot "Research Slot") .

After the factories are completed, you may build a few additional
factories or proceed with military build up. Produce normal infantry
units with engineer brigades. Engineer brigades are cheap and will allow
your troops to defend better, which is important as Poland. The only
other unit that you may want to build later in war time are garrisons
with MP brigade.

**Social Engineering**

Maximise hawk and then standing army. Every little org bonus is
necessary.

**Important Research**

Since Poland has a very limited [research](/wiki/Research "Research")
capacity, it is very important to prioritize. Always try to research in
the year that the tech is supposed to be researched. Do not even think
of researching Armor & Artillery, Naval, Naval Doctrine and Secret
Weapon. Think twice before researching anything in aircraft and air
doctrine.

-   Industrial: manufacturing, agriculture and cryptography.
-   Infantry: standard infantry, cavalry and supply.
-   Air: you may consider researching interceptor although it is
    difficult to produce enough of them to make a difference.

**Trades**

Your main trade partners are UK and France since they have enormous
amount of resources and will give you the best deals.

**Ministers**

-   Armaments Minister: use the person who gives +10% IC
-   Head of Intelligence: during peace time, you may want the person
    with +30% intelligence. However make sure before war to replace him
    with minister that gives bonus of +30% army intelligence.

###  Troop Placement 

A good strategy when the war starts is to capture the whole East Prussia
then turn to Slovakia and finally to Germany. The German AI only put a
few garrisons in East Prussia so it will fall quickly. Put one division
in Suwalki and 10 or more divisions in Torun. This is overkill but we
need to conquer Prussia as fast as possible.

Important provinces that you need to put a lot of garrisons are:
Bydgoszcz, Poznan and Cracow. Put at least 15 divisions each. For other
territories that are adjacent to Germany and Slovakia, put at least 6
divisions on each of them. Don’t bother putting any troops in other
provinces.

###    Danzig or War! 

By August 1939 your TC will most probably be overloaded and your troops
require a lot of supply. It means that Poland is ready for war! When
Germany announced its ultimatum, choose war.

Make sure you advance quickly to East Prussia. Troops in Suwalki and 9
divisions from Torun should advance to Konigsberg. After they reached
Konigsberg, use support attack to help the one division in Torun advance
to Elbing. Then crush the troops in Memel.

If Germany attacks a province, try to attack the provinces where they
are attacking from using your other troops. This will provide flanking
bonus, which reduces the attack efficiency. As a bonus, you can even win
territories with it.

You may lose battles and provinces. If you do, do not panic! Panicking
does not help, and prevents you from thinking clearly. Try to recapture
lost territories by using attacks from multiple directions.

###  Slovakia 

After you capture Prussia, turn the troops there south. Try to recapture
any lost provinces if there is any and then turn to Slovakia. Always
attack from multiple provinces at once or else it can be difficult to
win. Keep advancing and you will soon be able to annex Slovakia.

###  Germany 

Always try to keep as many troops in one province as possible when
facing Germany. Germany has a number of very large provinces such as
Kustrin and Cottbus that can serve as good chokepoints.

In the beginning, don’t bother trying to pocket the Germans. It is quite
difficult and may jeopardize your own position. Try to advance steadily
and slowly instead. Later, when you see the enemy number is decreasing
(check the ledger page), you may want to encircle them.

Advance slowly and attack from multiple direction. For example to
capture Stettin, attack from Danzig and support attack from Bydgoszcz.
Look where the enemy is the weakest at and attack that province (this is
one of the reasons why cryptography tech is useful). You may also try to
attack two provinces at once to confuse enemy on where to send
reinforcements.

It takes months, a lot of patience and skill but if you do it properly,
Germany will be gone.

###  Soviet Union 

Thinking of attacking the Soviet Union? By the time you annex Germany,
you will be very low on manpower. That reason alone is quite enough to
hold any invasion plan on USSR for a while. However, you may want to
demand territory from the Soviets. If you are lucky, you will gain free
territories where you have claim.

##  Walkthrough for 1936: Option 2 

This requires to attack from the word Go. It is easier to implement than
the walkthrough above as Germany does not have time for military
development.

This is a strategy to play Poland in the 1936 campaign and survive. Once
the survival goal has been achieved (about June 1937), what do to next
is an open question for which I would appreciate input.

Note: This strategy has been successfully tested against the computer on
Furious AI with difficulty level with set to Normal on Version 1.0 of
the game. Need to check it against 1.2 of the game. Will appreciate you
if you can add your comments for 1.2 to this note. (Please note that
this is as of now a work in progress, so if you edit this, your work
might get lost on further additions by me.)

I have been fascinated in working out the ideal strategy for Poland. My
first attempt was to gear up Poland for war using the three year
interval. While I have been moderately successful, I did not complete
the game to see whether what the end was. However, I then decided on the
strategy below, which works wonderfully.

What do you do:

###  Jan 1 1936 

Start Poland on the 1936 campaign. Disband aircraft and naval troops.
Separate cavalry troops and group them together. You will use them for
anti-partisian duty. Start researching Basic Machine Tools, and Trench
Warfare. Set your entire production to upgrading. For this prioritize
all other troops other than the reserves that you have (which have very
low strength), your cavalry troops, and your brigaded troops. Use
diplomacy settings to set Hawk Lobby one step to the right. I did it
this way, but I now think it would have been better to be more
Interventionist.

###  Jan 2 1936 

Get into a trade agreement with France for metals and rare materials by
giving away energy and oil.

###  End of Feb 1936 

You should be in a position where your 1918 troops (excepting reserves)
have been upgraded to 1936. Move them close to Czechoslovakia. Declare
war on it. Ouch, your dissent just increased by 10%. The key to winning
here is to arrange your troops so that you are able to penetrate hard
and fast. Identification of generals is important. Find ones with skill
and Offensive Doctrine. Find a commando leader for your mountain troops.
I put my reserves against Presov, and did not attack from there. I
attacked with 9 divisions into Kocise and won very easily. There are
anti-tank divisions which you can use to attack from Cracow where the
computer will put its tank divisions. Strike into the heart of the
country and within 15 days it is annexed. Controlling partisian activity
is a nuisance then. Set your troops systematically to control it. A unit
set on antipartisian activity will do so, in its and neighbouring
provinces as well. Use the cavalry units as they are not good for much
else. Also use the rest of your units till the time that they are free
so as to reduce partisan activity. Change your foreign minister to the
one who adds 10% to Foreign IC Use.

Your IC will now go up to 51. As such, this is a much faster way of
increasing your IC, then you would by building factories. You will also
one more research slot, which I put to researching agriculture.

Comment: playing with 1.3 the Allies declared war on Poland after the
attack on Czechoslovakia. Shortly Germany declared war on the Allies and
the whole circus began. The only alliance open to Poland is - the Axis!
Just make sure to annex Czechoslovakia before joining the Axis, or you
may lose some provinces to Hungary. If Hungary has not joined the Axis
yet, it makes for easy picking... Comment: pursuing this path has proven
a disaster so far, with the Soviet Union declaring war by late '36 and
Germany unable to even hold the Western Front against France. (the
original author is welcome to delete or incorporate these observations)

###  Apr to July 1936 

Upgrade the rest of your troops, reinforce them, and create one set of
1936 troops by producing them. I created 7. You are now ready to attack
Germany. Your dissent will go still higher to approx 27%. The troop
placement is as below: Put only enough troops in the heavily fortified
districts of the Czechoslovakia-German border so that you can defend.
You will attack from the Poland border. I put 6 troops in Strakonice,
since there are two districts adjoining to it. At the time of attacking
the computer had put three troops uniformly in every district in the
border with Poland. I attacked from Liberac into Breslau, and from
Crecstowa into Oppen. I also attacked all the Polish border provinces
(Sttetin, Kustrin). It is easy to win and gain access. The only annoying
factor was that I had put one troop unit each in Suwalki, Torun, Danzig,
and Bydo to protect against the troops in Elbing, and Konisberg. They
were not enough. I lost Torun first, and then Warsaw too. I had to send
a six unit troop back from the main war to polish up.

Control partisian activity as you go along. The hardest part came at the
end, where I had to defeat the German troops at the Franco-German
border, which is heavily fortified. This was done one province at a
time, and after a few heart stopping moments, I annexed Germany in Dec
1936.

###  Post Dec 1936 

Now I had Base IC of 113, but Actual IC was lower than Base IC. The
partisan effect had shot up to 30%. First I put all my troops on
antipartisan duty. This did not help much, so I identified the provinces
with high IC, and focused on that. This gave slightly better results.
However, the basic problem was the very high dissent. This was solved
over the next six months by setting all IC to consumer goods. I also
discovered that I had mistakenly taken the minister for supplies 20%+,
rather than IC 10%.

I now have a situation where I have Poland in June 1937 with 113 Base
IC, 131 Actual IC, 260 Transport Capacity, 45 1936 divisions, and
approximately 300 MP. What should be the course for Poland to follow.
The main threat from Germany has been nullified. The Soviet Union?
Attack France? Attack Italy?

This is a work in progress, and I would definitely appreciate comments.
Also any improvements.
