::: mw-parser-output
Paratroopers are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained
to either parachute to the ground or be ferried to a battle in gliders.
Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile
reserve or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines.
However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their
mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move
other units to their support.

## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

- Paratroop divisions are considered a soft unit.
- Paratroopers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard
  attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a
  normal infantry of the same year.

Paratroopers are much maligned by veteran players for several reasons:

- They require players to pursue two research trees (paratroopers and
  transport planes)
- Transport planes are extremely expensive in [IC
  days](/wiki/IC_days "IC days")
- Transport planes have very limited range
- Paratroopers are average at combat

Infantry 1939 12 18 10 7 95

This means that the Airborne unit requires 2,520 IC days versus 665 IC
days for Infantry, in exchange for considerably lower combat ability. A
player could build _four Infantry divisions_ (2,660 IC days) for a
roughly equivalent cost.

Paratroopers do have some positives:

- Fun to use
- Provide an extra envelopment angle if dropped into a battle. The
  bonus is then added to all your divisions engaged in the battle.
- Paratroopers can be dropped into an empty province behind the enemy
  to close encirclements.
- Paratroopers dropped on unprotected airfields will destroy all
  planes based there.
- After an enemy loses a battle and is retreating into an adjacent
  province, if that province is empty, paratroopers can \"overrun\"
  the retreating enemy to destroy them. This can also be used
  defensively.
- In critical battles, paratroopers can swing the outcome,
  specifically during amphibious assaults when only a relatively small
  number of marines can be used. Dropping paratroopers onto the beach
  province dramatically increases the chance of victory.
- Paratroopers can be used to instantly cover ground that would
  otherwise take weeks for ground forces, such as the huge, low
  infrastructure provinces in C. Asia, Africa and S. America.
