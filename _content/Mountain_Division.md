Notes
-----

*   Mountain divisions are considered soft units
*   Mountaineers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal infantry of the same year.
*   They get far less combat penalties when fighting in winter, frozen, snow or even blizzard conditions.
*   They get attack and defence bonuses in mountains and hills, which increase further along the tech tree.
*   In fact, the defence bonuses can get so staggeringly high that it becomes impossible to get a few mountaineer divisions out of a mountainous province during winter using conventional warfare.
