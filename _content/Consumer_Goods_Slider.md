##  Consumer Goods Slider 

The consumer goods slider allocates how much [Industrial
Capacity](/wiki/Industrial_Capacity "Industrial Capacity") you will use
for the subject. With certain slider settings, you may get big bonuses
of money from this slider. If you have
[dissent](/wiki/Dissent "Dissent") in your country, you can reduce it
with high enough Consumer Goods settings.
