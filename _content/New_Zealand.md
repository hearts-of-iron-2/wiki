##  Background 

New Zealand is little country with weak armed forces but playing with it
will be fun and challenging - as it has some advantages too.

-   **Advantages**
    -   Lots of powerful allies
    -   OK tech teams and a few are very good
    -   Isolationism: AI never attacks New Zealand
-   But there is lots of **disadvantages**
    -   Low [IC](/IC "IC") and only one tech slot
    -   Low manpower
    -   Weak army: land units have only ½ strength...
        -   Navy have only few transport ships, no cruisers or
            battleships
        -   No air force
    -   Dove lobby: low manpower growth

##  Before World War 

The first thing you need to do is building infantry. One infantry costs
4.82 IC so set production slider to 4 or 4.82 but then you must leave
reinforcing your first divisions. Try upgrade obsolete divisions and
reinforce old divisions... In politics New Zealand have one good thing,
it is *social democrat* . Move Democracy slider to Authoritarian to make
your goverment Left-Wing radical or Dove lobby slider to Hawk lobby. Do
not research or build tanks.

###    Research & Production 

Research and product

-   Basic [Infantry](/Infantry "Infantry")
-   Basic [Marines](/Marines "Marines")
-   Transports and/or destroyers

Don't

-   [Cavalry](/Cavalry "Cavalry") , it is not useful in island-to-island
    campaigns
-   [Battleships](/index.php?title=Battleships&action=edit&redlink=1 "Battleships (page does not exist)")
    (it will be take too long to build any battleships, if you don't use
    *no time limit* -mod =\])

&nbsp;

-   And really don't waste your low IC on tanks, which are also weak
    attacking islands

And if you have time, try to research some basic doctrines, New Zealands
best tech teams are doctrine-teams...

Regarding planes I won't comment. When I played with New Zealand I
didn't build any planes, but on the other hand I didn't conquered very
many provinces...

##  At war 

For New Zealand the main strategy is conquering Japanese islands. You
need transports, or you are prisoner in your home islands. Marines will
be good for operations like this and if you play well, you can start
amphibious assault on the [Japanese](/Japan "Japan") main Islands, where
you really will need good infantry and luck too..

-   Alternatively\* What I like to do with NZ, (I didn't write the above
    piece) is disband my CAV at the start, as they arent worth
    reinforcing, then spam INF and transport them to Africa where they
    can get XP stopping the Italians, as generally, the British AI
    doesn't fight too hard in Africa. Then take your troops into Italy
    itself, where the IC jackpot is. Try and get the RN to destroy the
    Italian navy first, or go gamey and splash out for a NAV squadron or
    two and bomb them. Then landing troops in Anzio for example is a
    piece of cake. I generally tend to ignore Japan, as they have plenty
    of trouble from the USA and Britain, and the gains to be made are
    quite small. Then, once the IC rolls in, build some tanks with the
    extra tech slots you'll have, or branch out into wherever you feel.
    Buying planes from Britain doesnt hurt, but you have to reinforce
    them. I used ground attack quite a bit, but have heard this has been
    nerfed in Arma 1.2 so thats a blow. Good luck, NZ is quite hard to
    play, but fun if you get it right.
