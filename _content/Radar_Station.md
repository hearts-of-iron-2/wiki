The functions are:

- Reduces enemy air units\' combat efficiency by 2.5% for each level
  of radar you have in the territory.
- The effectiveness of this factor can be increased by research. A 30%
  radar efficiency would mean 1.3\*2.5.
- Coastal radar stations have a combat air battle factor in adjacent
  seazones. On land, however, each province\'s radar is used only for
  that province without any adjacency effects.

  - Without it the airunits on air-superiority missions will just
    move towards random provinces within the area.
  - With it, the airunit will know about any planes nearby that is
    heading to/through the province with the radar.
- Radar [does not provide
  detection](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showpost.php?p=8204611&postcount=27){.external

- In ARMA, the radar naval brigade improves naval engagement range
- Since radar is intelligence related, it\'s always us vs them
  comparisons for spotting purposes. Slider (open vs closed society),
  relative tech levels for encryption and decryption, and difficulty
  levels influence how well radar detects the enemy.
