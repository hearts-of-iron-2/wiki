##  Overview 

Germany is one of the most played nations in HoI2. Using AAR production
as an indication of popularity, Germany is \#1 with hundreds of AARs on
the Paradox boards. USA is in 2nd place, and the USSR in 3rd place,
neither with more than one hundred. The reason for this is probably that
Germany is a nation with great potential that was foiled historically
and people enjoy ahistorical success. Success with Germany for veteran
players is fairly easy, even on very hard difficulty. For beginning
players, Germany can be a challenging nation.

Germany is fairly heavily event driven. With technology, production,
economy and politics set up properly, the game can run more or less
hands free for the first 3 years. Events will benefit Germany immensely,
so wait for them to happen, largely in 1938 and 1939. Events will also
lead Germany into war with the Allies, on August 31, 1939. By that date,
Germany should be fully prepared for war. Note that even veteran players
of HOI2, for the most part, abide by historical events at least until
war with Poland.

##  Technology 

Germany has the best research teams in the game which allows Germany to
be considerably far ahead of all her rivals in research. For example,
assuming Germany ignores Tank Destroyers and Anti-Tank Artillery
(considered worthless units in game), by May, 1937, it is possible for
Germany to have researched *every* 1936 and 1937 technology. By January
1, 1939, Germany is capable of having researched every 1938 technology
as well, with the only exception being aircraft carriers, which are not
commonly used as Germany. Advanced players may take different routes,
such as tech rushing key technologies. Since Germany's teams are so
strong, researching technologies 1 year in advance is comparatively
easy. The only point of weakness in German research is in the Navy.

**Industrial Research** I.G. Farben is the best manufacturing tech team
in the game. Use them for all your manufacturing research except
Production Planning, which only requires management so use Erich Von
Manstein (level 9 and has management) while I.G. Farben researches
Production Control. Every industrial field should be researched as
Germany with the exception of Radar.

Three tech-teams should be put on the following Industrial Research at
start:

-   Basic Machine Tools
-   Agrichemistry
-   Basic Computing Machine

**Infantry & Armor** Infantry and Supply are the most important research
topics here. Mountaineers are helpful in winter fighting, and marines
are helpful for Sea Lion. Paratroopers are generally not worth it. Light
and Medium Tank research is important for Germany. Static Anti-Air could
also be important if Germany doesn't plan on invading England.

**Naval & Naval Doctrine** Germany does not require a Navy to defeat the
Soviet Union, which is the most important objective. A Navy is useful,
however, for invading England and even the USA. Germany's Naval tech
teams are its weakest area, in addition to its naval doctrines, which
are not conductive to a surface fleet. A typical German navy will focus
exclusively on submarines for convoy raiding. A player that seeks to
make Germany into a Naval Superpower would abandon the Sealane
Interdiction doctrine, and likely go for Fleet-in-Being instead.

**Aircraft & Air Doctrine** Germany's air research teams are good enough
that it is possible to keep up to the latest technological level with
five of the eight aircraft types, in addition to nearly up to date
research on all air doctrine technologies for a player that devotes a
serious effort to it. For basics, however, Germany needs to only focus
on Interceptors, Close Air Support, and Tactical Bombers to be highly
successful.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

Germany will be able to enlist several nations into the Axis throughout
the course of the game. Through events, Germany can get Hungary,
Romania, and Bulgaria into the Axis. Finland, Vichy France, Japan and
Italy can manually be asked to join the Axis beginning in 1940 with
relatively high degrees of success. Note: bringing Japan into the war
will automatically bring USA into it as well. Germany can also manage to
convince some nations to join the Axis before the start of war (August
31, 1939), without using coups. While the list below seems fairly large,
Germany will only be able to focus on a few nations in a game due to the
costs involved in influencing nations. Generally, the most strategically
important allies from the below list are Nationalist Spain and Turkey.

[TABLE]

###  Sliders 

Germany's starting sliders are below average. Fortunately, Germany will
receive events that shift Germany fully to Hawk Lobby and
Interventionism by 1939. Thus, adjusting those sliders is not necessary.
Therefore, Germany's first slider moves should be towards Central
Planning: Germany is unable to move to free market due to its
Authoritarianism. This shift requires 4 moves (1936, 1937, 1938 & 1939)
in order to attain the valuable 25% IC bonus. Once this is achieved, in
1940, Germany should begin the move to Standing Army in order to get the
experience and organization bonuses. This can be accomplished by
January, 1942.

###  Ministers 

Germany's starting ministers have fairly good
[traits](/wiki/Minister_Traits "Minister Traits") , but the setup can be
improved. A few obvious changes should be made before occupation of the
Rhineland: Minster of Security: Gurtner; and Armaments Minister: Schacht
(10% IC bonus). Also Head of Intelligence to Oskar von Hindenburg is a
good idea if Germany is planning on influencing countries.

In 1937, switching the Foreign Minister to Ribbentrop is a good idea if
Germany plans on influencing countries.

In 1938 Germany might want to switch the Chief of Staff to Erich Hoepner
(5% Armour and artillery research and artillery construction bonuses)
until the war starts.

In 1939, Germany should switch to Minister of Security: Daluege in order
to benefit from +15% foreign IC use. When prompted for Schacht's
resignation by event, refuse due to his excellent 10% IC bonus. Chief of
Staff Ludwig Beck is a decent Chief of Staff (Land Unit speed +10%), but
not an obvious or necessary early pick. Germany also already has quick
land forces and switching to Fritz Bayerlein (+20% organization regain)
is probably the better choice here. In Armageddon, Germany should also
switch to Head of Intelligence: Hans Oster in order to benefit from his
5% IC bonus.

In 1941, switching to a Guns and Butter Chief of Army, like von
Blomberg, will improve the supply and TC situation.

For Naval Minister, the best pick depends on the naval policy:

-   **Decisive Naval Battle** is best for conventional [Surface Action
    Groups](/wiki/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") and
    [Cruizerg](/wiki/Surface_Action_Group#Cruizergs "Surface Action Group")
    fleets, but hurts carriers, available at start.
-   **Open Seas** is best for convoy defense, but makes subs more
    vulnerable, available at start.
-   **Indirect Approach** makes subs and BCs hit harder, but makes
    transports and destroyers more expensive, available from 1939.
-   **Base Control** makes marines, transports and destroyers cheaper,
    but also makes cruisers more expensive and hurts the offensive power
    of BBs and BCs, available from 1940.
-   **Power Projection** is not available for Germany.

For Air Force, **Army Aviation** and **Air Superiority** are both good
choices, but the NAV construction penalty with Air Superiority makes
Army Aviation a better pick. Both are available at start. Access to a
**Carpet Bombing** minister is gained in 1939 - which may be useful if a
long strategic bombing campaign against UK is planned. However this
requires research in relevant aircrafts and doctrines. **Vertical
Envenlopment** and **Naval Aviation** ministers are gained in 1944 and
1945.

See also a complete list of [German
Ministers](/wiki/German_Ministers "German Ministers") .

##  Intelligence 

Germany can make decent use of spies. Stealing blueprints will be only
marginally helpful, since Germany is usually far ahead of all its
adversaries in research. The best use of spies for Germany is simply to
identify troops levels in enemy nations, and to avoid having spies
within Germany. Japan, the UK, and the USA are all reasonable targets
for blueprint stealing -- any other nations are sure to be far behind
Germany in their research.

##  Economy 

Germany has a very strong economy that can rival the USA in time.

###  Trading 

Germany has a general need for rares, oil, and metal, thus trading
should secure those resources, and preferably build large stockpiles. To
some extent, Germany can trade excess energy for supplies, which helps
redirect IC elsewhere. Germany's strongest trading partners:

-   Soviet Union: trade energy, supplies, and cash for metal and rare
    materials
-   Romania: Will trade supplies and oil for energy.
-   Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Switzerland: Will trade supplies for
    energy
-   Brazil: get some rare materials in exchange for energy and/or some
    supplies.
-   Venezuela: offers a lot precious oil in exchange for supplies.
-   Nationalist China will trade a small amount of oil for supplies,
    while Japan may trade metals and rares for oil.

###  Industrial Production 

The majority of Germany's IC capacity should go into factory building.
Upgrades should be ignored until 1939, since Germany will advance
several technologies over the course of the first few years, and will
thus benefit from the leap-frog effect. At a minimum, Germany can create
a parallel run of 12 factories, with at least 2 serial runs (e.g. 24 new
factories by December, 1937). Advanced players sometimes perform 3
serial runs of factories, but this requires a very rapid buildup and
organization of your armed forces in 1939, which can be challenging for
new players.

##  Military 

###  Army 

The majority of the German Army (Wehrmacht) should consist of infantry.
[Militia](/wiki/Militia "Militia") can also be helpful if used properly,
since Germany has a need for defensive divisions to hold front lines
(especially against the Soviet Union). An efficient Infantry/Militia mix
for defensive lines is a 9 division army of 4 militia and 5 infantry.
Ideally, around 75% of the German Army should consist of
infantry/militia before the onset of Barbarossa, with the remaining 25%
being tanks and motorized infantry. Building too many tanks is a common
mistake for new players, due to high fuel/supply costs and TC load.
Unless, of course, you are playing *very* historical and seek to emulate
the failures of Germany! As a general rule, Germany may have oil
shortages (exacerbated with a heavy emphasis on vehicles), and will
definitely have TC problems as the invasion of the Soviet Union
progresses. [Additional

###  Navy 

The German Navy (Kriegsmarine) has two practical/realistic options:

-   Limited Navy: This is the historical route of building U-boats
    en-mass (the 1938 submarine is a key component). Submarines can be
    used (in DD) for very successful convoy raiding on England. Doing
    this will simply hurt England's military overseas (Africa and
    India). In some sense, this is not a very important strategic goal
    for Germany, even though convoy raiding can be very successful (see
    Blue Emu's "Are Submarines Worthless" thread). In ARMA submarines
    are more powerful, and when serving in large wolf packs (30 sub
    stacks), they can seriously damage nearly any opposing fleet.
-   Surface Fleet: Germany can abandon the [Sealane
    Interdiction](/wiki/Sealane_Interdiction "Sealane Interdiction")
    doctrine favored by submarines, and go for the
    [Fleet-in-Being](/wiki/Fleet-in-Being "Fleet-in-Being") doctrine. On
    this route, Germany can build Battleships (SHBB & BB) and use
    destroyers as screens. This requires considerable time and
    investment, but when combined with light carriers, Germany will be a
    formidable Naval power.

###  Air Force 

The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) has a large variety of options.
Generally, an emphasis on TAC and CAS bombers is the most effective use
of firepower against land forces. These will help the German Army
significantly eliminate enemy divisions in mass, effectively negating
the manpower advantage held by adversaries such as the Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, Germany can be successful with large numbers of INT in order
to defend against frequent Allied bombing attacks. Since German strategy
is contingent on fast conquest of enemy land, STR bombers are not
particularly useful. They are also more expensive to build, unless the
Chief of Air Force is switched. Later in the game, adding FTR is
recommended, since the short range and the upgrade path of INT will hurt
during World conquest campaigns.

##  Events 

These events do more than what is specified below, but this is just a
summary of the major effects. All events have triggers that will
normally trigger unless Germany does something erratic, like starting
the war ahead of schedule. Since these events are so helpful to Germany,
most players play historically through events.

**Re-occupation of the Rhineland:**

At the very start of the scenario, you need to move at least one ground
unit to Cologne. This will trigger an event called "Re-Occuptation of
the Rhineland" which will give:

-   +1 Hawk Lobby

If you dont trigger this event, you will recieve "Great War
Manifestation" events that give you +3 dissent until you move a unit
into Cologne. So dont wait! You have a unit nearby when the scenario
starts, just march in there.

**Anschluss of Austria:**

March 1938: Assuming you make the historical choice and the AI accepts:

-   Annex Austria
-   +1 Authoritarianism
-   +1 Hawk Lobby (occurs when Austria accepts, not in original event)

**Treaty of Munich:**

September 29th, 1938: Assuming you make the historical choice and the AI
accepts:

-   Annex Sudetenland
-   +1 Hawk Lobby
-   +3 Interventionism
-   +1 Hawk Lobby (occurs when Czech accepts, not in original event)

**The End of Czechoslovakia:**

March 14th, 1939: Assuming you make the historical choice and the AI
accepts:

-   Annex Czechoslovakia
-   Create puppet Slovakia OR give territory to Hungary and they join
    Axis
-   +1 Interventionism
-   +1 Hawk Lobby (occurs when Czech accepts, not in original event)

**Claiming Memel:**

March 23rd, 1939: Assuming you make the historical choice and the AI
accepts:

-   Lithuania cedes Memel province
-   +1 Interventionism

**Total Domestic Policy Shift** Assuming Germany makes all the
historical choices and the AI always accepts:

-   +1 Authoritarianism
-   +5 Interventionism
-   +5 Hawk Lobby

This is sufficient to totally max out the Hawk Lobby and Interventionism
Sliders

##  War 

Since Germany is the most event driven nation of the game, most players
(noob and veteran alike) conduct war on the basis of events. Since
Germany is a major power, however, early war is a possibility, including
[early
annexations](/wiki/Germany_Early_Annexations "Germany Early Annexations")
. Generally, however, early war is viewed as gamey and too easy for
Germany.

###  Condor Legion: Spanish Civil War 

On 18 July 1936, the Spanish Civil War (SCW) breaks out. Nationalist
Spain will likely loose without German intervention. While the
intervention by event helps, Nationalist Spain will typically require
direct intervention of the German Army, which means war with Republican
Spain. A friendly Spain serves two strategic goals for Germany:

-   Access to Gibraltar, which allows Germany to help seize control of
    the Mediterranean Sea for [Italy](/wiki/Italy "Italy") .
-   A soft underbelly to France, making the invasion of France easier.

Historically, Nationalist Spain was neutral in the war and German
intervention was limited. Involving Germany in the SCW is by no means
necessary, and is generally only used by players seeking total
dominance. Also it changes the French AI to a more aggressive one and
thus ensures an early DOW from France. (France becomes more
interventionist when it goes with "Send Material and Volunteers" in the
Spanish Civil War.) When France DOWs early, the Soviet Union often
follows. This can lead to a weird game where Poland and Czechoslovakia
want to join the Axis.

###    Fall Grün: Czechoslovakia 

Generally, Czechoslovakia can be annexed and made into a puppet entirely
through events, as happened historically. On rare occasion, however,
Czechoslovakia will refuse German annexation plans, and Germany will be
forced to choose to let well enough alone or fight. The Czech army is
not a concern due to its very limited size, but its forts in the
Sudetenland are very powerful owing to a level 10 size, and hilly
terrain. Ostrava, Brno, and Bratislava all do not have forts and border
Germany. Thus, this underbelly makes victory fairly swift and relatively
easy because the Sudentenland does not have any victory points.

###    Fall Weiß: Poland 

On 1 September 1939, the war with Poland and the Allies begins by event.
Germany will need enough troops (around 6 divisions each) in the three
provinces bordering France to protect her Western front. Defeating
Poland is possible within two weeks. The [HQ Units in
Action](/wiki/HQ_Units_in_Action "HQ Units in Action") strategy guide
provides an excellent guide in the effective use of HQ units, combined
with armor and motorized infantry, in order to quickly annex Poland.

###  Fall Gelb: France 

After Poland is annexed, Germany's next significant target is France. In
order to get to France, an invasion of the low countries is necessary.
Strictly speaking, only war with Belgium is necessary. An invasion of
the Netherlands provides Germany IC and large supply stockpiles after
the capture of their capital. While neither nation can be "annexed" by
taking their European holdings, events fire that ensure Germany receives
their European land as "national" provinces. Luxembourg can be annexed
before declaring war on the other two.

The invasion of the Low Countries and ultimately France can begin as
soon as forces arrive from the defeat of Poland; e.g. sometime in
October, 1939. Historically, Germany waited until May, 1940, when
weather conditions were more favorable. This can be a problem for
inexperienced players attacking too early, and make for some good, early
lessons for what not to do when fighting the Soviet Union! Veteran HOI2
players are able to defeat France in less than 2 weeks, primarily
through the use of around 5 - 10 tank divisions.

The primary intent of a successful Blitzkrieg is a spearhead attack that
cripples the enemy. This means a direct spearhead to Paris. It is
possible for the invasion route to go through the forests of France
(Liege -\> Reims -\> Compiegne to Paris), however tanks do quite poorly
in the winter in the forest. A more tank friendly route is Ghent -\>
Lille -\> Amiens -\> Paris. Once Paris is captured, German forces can
branch out in all directions to make a dash for land. When France looses
enough territories, it wil surrender.

The event asking for the creation of Vichy France can occur if:

-   Paris is not under France's control.
-   France lost 25% of its national provinces.
-   Germany is at war with France.
-   Germany is not at war with Soviet.
-   The year is before 1942.
-   France is not a puppet of Germany.
-   Vichy is not a puppet of Germany.

The event has 25% chance of triggering every 3 days. If France loses at
least 40% of its national provinces, the event will automatically
trigger. Note that the AI France has 3% chance of rejecting the creation
of Vichy. If this happens, Germany is forced to occupy the entire French
territory. Accepting the creation of Vichy if the best move for Germany,
since it provides Western France as national provinces and drastically
lowers dissent, while also providing a reasonably powerful ally.

###    Weserübung: Denmark and Norway 

This is completely optional.

The advantage of capturing Denmark is rendering Baltic Sea unreachable
by UK’s (and later USA’s) navy as well as giving you a launching pad to
the American continent (provided you do not let Denmark surrenders event
to trigger, see below). However, the benefit from Norway is much more
subtle. You only gain a low amount of resource and a not very feasible
route to the USSR. The best reason why you want to invade Norway is
probably because it is part of operation Fall Weserübung. The additional
ports might also be useful if you decide to go for starving Britain with
submarine warfare.

A very easy way to defeat Denmark is to capture the province Kolding.
There is 99% chance that Denmark will ask for cease fire and then a few
days later Denmark is annexed “peacefully” by Germany. Unfortunately if
you take this path, you will lose Greenland and Iceland to USA. See the
method on how to prevent it in
[tricks](/wiki/Germany_Strategy_Guide#Annexing_Denmark_with_Greenland_and_Iceland "Germany Strategy Guide")
section.

Revisiting Norway, a simple and low-risk means of capturing it is by
first taking Sweden. This may be accomplished with relative ease by
landings just north and South of Stockholm supplemented by an attack
from the Odense or Copenhagen. With Sweden in hand, simply walk into
Oslo and Narvik from the adjacent Swedish provinces. Alternatively,
capture Oslo and Narvik with paratroopers, then annex Norway
immediately.

###    Directive 25: Yugoslavia, and Operation Marita: Greece 

This is completely optional, if you do not wish to invade them, skip
right to USSR section.

Securing Yugoslavia and Greece is useful since it makes your allies
stronger and gives you access to the Mediterranean Sea. After the
annexation of Yugoslavia, you will receive an event that allows you to
create Croatia. Creating it will remove some TC burden as well as
gaining more manpower and three divisions, making it a good option.

Greece may provide a little harder challenge. It is relatively easy to
conquer all of the VPs except the last VP in Crete. The best way to
capture it is probably by sending paratroopers on airborne assault.
Amphibious assault may prove to be difficult if you or Italy has not
neutralized UK’s navy.

###  Operation Barbarossa: Taming the Bear 

-   *See the article [Germany Strategy- Taming the
    Bear](/wiki/Germany_Strategy-_Taming_the_Bear "Germany Strategy- Taming the Bear")*

####  The Bitter Peace 

Conditions that must be satisfied to trigger bitter peace:

-   Germany controls Paris.
-   Germany is not at war with Italy and Japan.
-   Do not sign the Tripartite pact with Japan if you intend to attack
    the USSR without them. Just sign it with Italy.
-   Soviet does not control these provinces:
    -   Leningrad (one of the northern provinces, very close to Finland)
    -   Moscow
    -   Stalingrad
    -   Baku (southern province, next to Persia)
    -   Sverdlovsk (in Trans-Siberia railway, quite far away)

If you fulfill those conditions, there is 5% chance every week that
Stalin may sue for peace. When the event triggers, there is 90% chance
USSR will surrender and Germany will obtain a large amount of provinces.
Unfortunately if Soviet refuses, the war goes on and you may need to
annex USSR to claim victory. The refusal message is: Soviet Union went
with Fight to the bitter end! in Sue for peace with the Germans

There are two Bitter Peace chains, one with Japan in the Axis and one
without.

-   Without the Tripartite pact being signed by Japan and without Japan
    in the Axis, \# Sue for peace with the Germans, event 2624 SOV
    starts the event chain which is completed by the Germans accepting
    it: event 2024 GER \# Stalin sues for Peace (Japan is not Axis).
-   Providing Japan is in the Axis (and at war with Soviet), Sverdlovsk
    is not required. But Soviet must lose Vladivostok (next to Japan's
    Korea). Event 2645 SOV which triggers event 2046 GER
-   There is a third and somewhat unusual Bitter Peace if you are not at
    war with the Allies (UK, France and USA), you only need to conquer
    25% of the Soviet national provinces (note that Eastern Poland
    provinces are not Soviet's national provinces).

####  The Bitter Peace in Doomsday 

The ideas are generally the same, but there are some significant
differences in Doomsday:

1\) The Tripartite Pact is now irrelevant. Offer it to both Japan and
Italy since there are no Bitter Peace problems.

2\) If Japan is Axis or fighting the Soviet Union, the 5th Russian
province can be either Sverdlovsk or Vladivostok. The other 4 needed
Russian provinces remain Baku, Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad, and
either Germany or Vichy France has to own Paris.

3\) The AI has to accept the Bitter Peace, there's now a 100% chance of
the AI accepting the Bitter Peace once it fires.

4\) The % chance for the event to fire has been increased to random = 35
meaning that it should fire in 3 or 4 weeks, but there is no guarantee
that it will fire, just a much increased chance that it will fire. Also
the time interval between checks has been changed from every 7 days to
every 10 days.

5\) Other conditions such as Paris not being controlled by France are
still the same. Either Germany or Vichy must control Paris.

6\) When the Bitter Peace fires, you get 150 provinces at only 2% base
partisan levels with a dissent reduction of 50%.

####  puppet states 

If enough provinces in the vicinity of Sverdlovsk can be captured, you
might be able to create the puppet state of Transural Republic before
the Bitter Peace fires. In like manner you can create some puppet states
in the southern region of central Asia near
[Persia](/wiki/Persia "Persia") . If you still have these states when
the Bitter Peace fires, they will remain in the Axis. If you later
declare war on Persia it may annex some of the central Asian puppets,
but when you then annex Persia you get the whole thing!

###  Gibraltar 

There are two ways to reach Mediterranean Sea, from Gibraltar and Suez.
Having these two provinces will mean the whole sea is in your control.
The problem with capturing Gibraltar is that it is not possible to
conduct amphibious assault there. You may try using airborne invasion,
invite Spain into your alliance, ask military access to Spain (almost
impossible) or invade Spain (best for practical reasons).

During the Soviet war you should try to work on Spain and getting them
into your alliance. If they do join then take control of Spanish army
and capture Gibraltar with them. Failing that, you need to declare war
on Spain in order to obtain Gibraltar.

Alternatively, intercede on Nationalist Spain's behalf during their
civil war. Do this by first guaranteeing their independence, then
declaring war on Republican Spain (who has a province next to
Gibraltar). This will make Nationalist Spain want to join the Axis. Now,
you can either just help them win the war, or, if you're a greedy one
like me, use the Nationalist Spain fleet to transport your armies (use
Send Expeditionary Force to allow them to board) to the southern end of
Spain and from there conquer Republican Spain for Germany.

Gibraltar is frequently unguarded, so you can alternatively capture it
with paratroopers from Bordeaux, saving you the intervention in Spain.

###  Reaching Africa 

After the fall of Gibraltar, the most important British territory in
Africa is Suez. Controlling this will mean controlling Mediterranean
Sea. There are a number of feasible ways to reach Suez:

-   Annex Turkey or Persia and then Iraq (slow because of the poor
    infrastructure of these regions)
-   Annex Turkey or Greece to open more ports (you can launch amphibious
    landings on Alexandria from Athens)
-   If you have a strong navy, put him under Grand Admiral Raeder and
    make amphibious landing in Africa

If you manage to land in Africa with sufficient force, you can chase
them out of the continent for good.

###    Operation Seelöwe: Great Britain 

This can be done before or after gaining complete control of North
Africa or even just after the creation of Vichy France. To invade UK
successfully you need either a large surface navy (with two or more
carriers) or a navy full of submarines. Other units that will prove
useful are marines, fighters/interceptors, naval bomber and tactical
bomber.

Southern and Eastern provinces of British island are the natural choices
for amphibious landing. The best province depends on the province's
garrison as well as its adjacent provinces' troops. If the province is
lightly defended but an adjacent province has a very large army, you
should think twice since that large army may obliterate your landing
troops. To see the number of troops in provinces that do not have coast
line, use fighters on air superiority over the areas where those
provinces at.

The landing party should consist of three marine divisions. Sending more
than three divisions will reduce the effectiveness of the whole
invasion. Make sure to put the tactical bomber on interdiction and
fighters on air superiority to get a beachhead. Since the specific
province that is going to be bombed is decided by AI, you may need to
follow where your bomber goes. It is not very nice but it works. Success
in doing it will spell the doom of the British island.

Another effective way to gain a beachhead is to move your invasion
forces next to Cardiff, land paratroopers there, and sail your forces to
the now peaceful port. Why? Because Cardiff has no beach to land on, the
AI does not defend it, so you can easily capture it with just 1
paratrooper. If landed at nightfall, you will have till dawn to move
your transports into the port. No amphibious assaults needed! Another
good province for an airborne assault is Norwich, from where you can
easily strike at the heart of England.

It may be a good idea if you combine operation Sealion with invasion in
Ireland and Iceland (if you did not try to
[keep](/wiki/Germany_Strategy_Guide#Annexing_Denmark_with_Greenland_and_Iceland "Germany Strategy Guide")
it). Iceland will serve as a good launch pad for further invasion on
Greenland and America.

###  Made in India 

With British island gone, African possessions ransacked, only India left
for UK. The best attack route is from Persia. You can create a puppet
Pakistan if you capture enough provinces in western India, and from
there you can annex
[Nepal](/wiki/index.php?title=Nepal&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nepal (page does not exist)")
and [Bhutan](/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan") , though the infrastructure
(Himalayas) may be challenging. There is an event 13 that can lead to
UK's surrender. The conditions are:

-   Paris is in German hand or Germany is not at war with France
-   London is captured by Germany
-   UK lost at least 75% IC
-   UK lost at least 75% VPs
-   Germany is not at war with Soviet
-   Germany is not at war with USA

UK has 50% chance to accept it. If it does, UK will surrender a number
of provinces to Germany, Italy, Canada and USA as well as liberating
Lebanon, Egypt, India and Jordan. Chances are if you are able to trigger
the event, you can completely annex UK very easily. Because of this
reason and the fact that the benefit of accepting the peace is very
small, it is a good idea to strive for total annexation of UK.

###  USA 

It is very difficult to land directly in US coasts. An easier route is
from Canada. Capture Iceland, Greenland and then proceed to Canada. If
you manage to stockpile troops in Canada and invade USA's mainland, you
will see that its defence is very weak. The problem with invading the
North American continent via Canada is Canada's poor infrastructure. An
alternative strategy that doesn't slow your forces down is to capture
Newfoundland and from there parachute into Boston. Use Boston as a
beachhead for landing your invasion force (which should be in the region
of 100 and above divisions). Strike fast at New York and Washington -
New England is the USA's industrial heartland. After an intense initial
battle, the rest should be a walkover.

There is an event that allows German Player to demand USA's surrender.
The conditions of USA surrender to Germany are:

-   USA lost at least 75% IC
-   USA lost at least 75% VPs
-   Germany is not at war with Soviet
-   Germany is not at war with UK

There is 50% chance that AI USA will accept the offer. If it does,
Germany will receive three provinces and there will be a large change in
USA’s government. Else you can always spend a few more months to annex
USA.

##  Miscellaneous 

###  Advantages 

**High Quality Tech Teams**

-   I.G. Farben is the best manufacturing research tech team in the
    game.
-   Konrad Zuse is one of the best cryptographic research tech teams in
    the game, ensuring further dominance in research.
-   Top Tier tech teams for all other areas except Naval Doctrines.

**Strong Stable Industrial Base**

-   Scattered industrial areas difficult to effectively bomb
    strategically even from England.
-   Pre-War industry in top tier allowing long build up.
-   Easy conquests of IC rich areas (Essentially All of Continental
    Europe).

**Excellent Starting Land Doctrines**

-   Only one Land Doctrine to research between 1936 and 1939 to have
    best land doctrine in the world available at the time.

**Good Consumer Goods Income**

-   Even producing the minimum consumer goods available, peacetime
    revenue is sufficient to support extensive espionage.

**Excellent Leaders**

-   Start with large numbers of 3-5 skill generals of various rank.
-   Top tier air generals (not better than England, but damn good).
-   Top tier admirals (again, not better than England, but good).
-   Including Rommel, Manstein, Guderian etc

**Good Starting Units**

-   Larger starting army than any European power except USSR.
-   Large starting airforce

**Optimal Domestic Sliders for Warfare by 1939**

-   Lots of free event-driven movements towards Hawk Lobby &
    Interventionism.
-   Player can use their manual slider movements as they wish without
    being beholden to Hawk Lobby or Interventionism.
-   Free DOWs available relatively quickly allows conquest of numerous
    minor nations without dissent.

**Flexiblity to choose from a wide range of Force Compositions**

-   Flexible starting forces & solid industry enable the player to build
    whatever army/navy/airforce compositions they want.

**Good Historical Events**

-   No huge dissent events.
-   No events force-switching or killing your good cabinet members.
-   Free annexations via event
-   Free declarations of war via event, like *Danzig or war*

###  Disadvantages 

**Weak Allies**

-   Poor quality expeditionary divisions from allies.
-   Poor quality tech teams for allies.
-   Few in number with low IC prevents good blueprint trading from
    occuring.

**Enemies with far-flung possessions that are not easily annexed**

-   UK possesses tiny islands all over the world with victory point
    values
-   USSR has enormous territorial depth. Germany must reach Pacific to
    annex.
-   USA seperated from Germany by huge ocean and strong navy with
    enormous IC power.

**Relatively Poor Starting Naval Forces**

-   Without substantial investment, no possibility of victory vs major
    rivals.

**Limited access to Naval Doctrines and mediocre naval doctrine tech
teams**

-   Kriegsmarinewerft is a good naval unit tech team, but Raeder is your
    only really good naval doctrine tech team.
-   Only access to a few carrier enhancing doctrines useful in the late
    game naval war vs USA.

**Must stand alone vs enemies with enormous manpower reserves**

-   Even with immediate research of manpower boosting techs, very
    difficult to match Soviets or USA in divisions.
-   Poor planning can cause you to exhaust your manpower pool and find
    yourself unable to reinforce your units, much less build more.

**Poor Raw Materials production pre-war**

-   Peacetime trading strategy must be focused on acquiring [rare
    materials](/wiki/Rare_Materials "Rare Materials") , usually at the
    price of supplies (i.e. purchased with IC).
-   After expanding throughout Europe, less of a problem. Especially
    after extensive stockpiling of resources during peacetime.

**Mediocre Metal production**

-   Can be mitigated through numerous energy-for-metal trades with minor
    nations (Sweden makes a 1-for-1 offer every couple months).

**Located in the center of Europe**

-   Although this makes it attacking easier, it also means Germany is
    surrounded by enemies.
-   Multi-front situation can be managed if Operation Sealion is
    successful before 1941.

##  Gamey Tactics 

Germany has a variety of [gamey
tactics](/wiki/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") possible.

###  Germanic Ireland: Totally Optional 

When the game starts, build a whole bunch of transports and create about
2 Tank divisions, 3 Militias, and about 2 infantry. (Ireland is only
given one infantry division so you can easily bomb rush them). quickly
board up your troops and head toward Ireland. This will create you a
small navel base to attack the british mainland. It will help you attack
Brest and having a 2 sided french attack.

###  The Unholy Alliance 

If you press F12 and then key in and enter event 2015 you get the
"Unholy Alliance" option with the Soviet Union. Choosing this could
backfire if Japan hasn't had the Nomahan Incident yet. If Japan then
chooses "This defeat must be avenged" you'll find yourself fighting
Japan!

##  Germany multiplayer strategy 

###  Prolog 

Have you ever tried to play with Germany and for some reason lost in
multiplayer game? It will change now. The main point is, that you have
to build a very strong and speedy army. You can't only focus on
infantry. Of course you need them, too, but what you really need
(especially against Soviet Union) are motorized and armored units. If
you follow my instructions, you will be very strong opponent in the
future.

###  Blitzkrieg 

At the beginning build factories. Only factories. When the war breaks
out, you don't have much army but enough to invade Poland. Then, start
to build 6 motorized units and 3 armored units, and airforces and some
infantry. When you attack France in 1940, there is just no way you could
lose, because your army is so tough. French infantry just can't do much
against them. You should attack the Soviet Union in 1941. Just keep
pumping more armors and mechanized/motorized units. And when the battle
begins, use blitzkrieg. Use all your airforce to destroy the enemy's
poor infantry, and move forward with your units. You'll see that this
strategy is very simple and effective.

  

##    Year 1939 –40 Invading Poland and France 

Invading Poland should be easy thing to do, altough your army isn’t so
great yet. Remember to leave some garrisons against France. It is always
good to remember necessary defence. But the main point against Poland is
your airforce. Bomb enemy units down and then you won’t lose so much
manpower either. When Poland has been annexed you should immediately
start to move your units against France, but don’t attack yet. Just
wait. But during this ‘phony war’ you should start to build very tough
army. First of all, start to pump 3 tanks and 6 motorized infantry +
headquarters and some infantry (and CAS!!). With this strategy you will
see that France will surrender very soon. If player who plays with
United Kingdom transports all his/her allies there, they can’t fight
against your tanks. This is so obvious, because tanks have so good
toughness and with self propelled brigades they are almost impossible to
destroy. BUT!! You have to be careful that you don’t use your tanks and
motorized units wrong. Don’t try to attack through mountains or mud or
you will ruin everything. With this strategy weather is very important.
So when you attack to France (after you have invaded Denmark \[don’t
attack to Norway\]) just invade Netherlands and Belgium and push forward
to Reims. Just bomb enemy’s separated units and try to force him/her to
move his/her units to Reims. The you have to be speedy. Attack with 8
CAS at night and 8 in morning. Then, concentrate 11 tanks+ HQ + 15
motorized + 20 infantry to Reims, and use some good panzer general.
Then, you’ll see, you can’t lose. Then push forward to Paris, and try to
destroy as many Britons you can.

##    Year 1941 – Operation Barbarossa 

COMING SOON
