The Submarine is designed to travel underwater allowing it to operate
clandestinely against other naval units. Its main armament consists of
torpedoes which are deadly against all other types of vessel, be they
Carrier, Battleship, Naval Transport or another Submarine. However, the
Submarine can be handicapped by a short range and new technologies to
improve them can be expensive.
