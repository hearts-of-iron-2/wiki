##  Overview 

The Netherlands are sitting next to a potential, violent country called
Germany, so they should better be prepared. They start with a nice
amount of IC, relatively advanced research at start and very good tech
teams. Besides the starting position the main problem will always be
exactly one: manpower. The Dutch colonies are some of the very best in
the game and that´s the reason why this guide suggests to play a game
where you try to hold them. So the two goals are:

-   Survive in Europe
-   Hold and/or retake the colonies against Japan.

Another viable strategy is to concentrate on Europe and grab as much
land as possible from the Germans when the Allies or the Soviets are
near your borders in ´43-´45.

##  Technology 

First: The usual industry techs (of course including all the manpower
techs), infantry, land doctrine, DD´IV. The two most important things
are: The third construction tech must be ready in mid ´37 and you should
have fighters II researched in time (\~early to mid 40), so they can be
built when the fortifications are finished. I suggest to go for fighters
as the interceptors have the extra rocket techs and also worse range and
worse ground/sea attack.

If there is spare research time air doctrines should be researched. From
´40 on, with fighters II researched, air doctrines should become a
priority.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

When Germany DoW´s the Netherlands they will join the Allies. According
to the forum it is possible to join Axis instead of being attacked,
obviously the game will develop a bit different then.

###  Sliders 

There are no free moves. Move towards full free market. Then try not to
be Market liberal. There are too many events that move the free market
slider away from full free market when the government is ML.

##  Intelligence 

Early on the Netherlands can profit from stolen blueprints but the IC is
needed for building the fortifications. Later, the UK will deliver
enough blueprints for free, so stealing blueprints is neither necessary
nor advantageous.

##  Economy 

###  Trading 

The Netherlands can trade away rares for anything they need with nearly
everybody they want. Oil will be needed later, so it is important to
build a stockpile.

###  Industrial Production 

The "Fortress Netherlands" only works one way: At first two rounds of
IC, then with the third construction tech ready switch to fortifications
completely. Only with the additional IC the Netherlands can build the
needed four runs of fortifications as soon as the third construction
tech becomes available and the needed infantry as well. If the
Netherlands build this way, all border provinces should have level-10
fortifications by spring ´40.

AA is a good idea to build as well as it protects against strategic
bombing effectively, but also uses much precious manpower. As the
Netherlands will loose IC in Indonesia some IC should be build in ´41
and ´42 as the third research slot is needed.

##  Military 

###  Army 

By ´40 the Netherlands need three infantry divisions in every fortress.
As the AI loves to land at unprotected beaches also place militias at
the Dutch ones. With your production on fortifications it will be hard
to build much, but there is enough IC (due to the IC building) to build
enough troops. Save manpower for later, don´t build all in infantry.

###  Navy 

Early in the game there is not enough IC, but from mid 40 on the
Netherlands can build a few DD´s that come in very handy against German
subs. Not a top priority, but one serial of DD-IV´s eats up only a bit
IC and after a year the Dutch fleet can hunt German wolfpacks.

###  Air Force 

From ´40 on most of the IC should be used to build planes. First
fighters (at least eight are needed), then, when research is done and IC
available, CAS. In order to be able to sink enemy convoys and ships the
Dutch Air Force should include fighters to CAS-groups.

##  Events 

##  War 

###  Europe 

The land war in Europe is, hopefully, boring. There is not much the
Netherlands can do but sitting in their fortifications and watch France
fall. But there is one problem that needs to be addressed: Convoy
losses. As manpower grows slowly, there has to be done something against
the Germans. Luckily subs are not the main threat but enemy nav bombers.
And against those bombers the Dutch have built fighters, so the threat
for Dutch convoys can be banned. Subs also hurt, but not as badly as
those navs. The Netherlands should be able to hunt and kill all enemy
nav bombers. It will take some time - mainly because the Air Force is
too small at the beginning - but it is possible.

It helps to micromanage the convoys to minimize losses. Use one, and
only one, convoy at any time with all available convoy ships and
escorts. Switch the islands you fetch the resources from every few days.
This way all the important stuff from the islands is delivered to the
capital, but there is only one potential target for enemy navs and subs.
That minimizes the convoy losses significantly.

Send as many troops as you can afford to Asia for the next war,
hopefully there are some Belgian/French expeditionary forces, so you can
spare a few.

###  Pacific 

When the convoy losses are under control, the fighter force big (for a
medium power) and when the Netherlands finally get bored and start to
build CAS as well then, most likely, Japan will join the war. In
Armageddon, Japan comes with massive forces early and fast, there is no
chance for the Netherlands to hold on against the onslaught the direct
way. What does work is to send as many troops down as possible and send
down the complete air force and hold an air base/harbour. Choose a
province with terrain that helps the defender. Still, the planes are not
strong enough to fight the Japs directly, so hit the convoys. It takes
time, but it works effectively. Only then, when the Netherlands managed
to hold a bit of Indonesia and sunk all Japanese convoys the Netherlands
can start to sink enemy ships and start to retake the lost islands.

It is micromanagement to use the air force to spot enemy fleets and
squeeze through it with Dutch DD´s and transports, but it is fun if it
works. If you are lucky you get a manpower event. In that case, the
Netherlands can even take the Japanese home islands with a relatively
big DD-fleet and air force and a few ground troops.

###  Europe II 

If the war develops relatively historical the Netherlands can grab some
land from Germany before it collapses. Watch the map carefully as soon
as Allies or Soviets move next to the fortress and try to move out at
the right time to take some land.

  

This guide is based on a Netherlands game played in Armageddon 1.2. I
did it nearly the same way in Doomsday, but never lost most of Indonesia
and was able to go on the offensive earlier.
