###  Fleet In Being 

FIB focuses on naval supremacy through (non CV) capital ships, and helps
to maintain your colonial empire. It has the best BB and BC positioning
scores, the best organisation, and the best convoy escort and ASW
ratings. It will also gain convoy the escort bonus slightly earlier than
BS, and it's a nice counter to SLI. This tree ends in 1944.
