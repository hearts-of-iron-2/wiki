### Why isn't [Rommel](/wiki/Rommel "Rommel") in the game in 1936?

Before being promoted to the rank of Major General in September, 1939, [Erwin Rommel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel) was first an instructor and then commander of the War Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He is not in the game before 1939 because Major General is the lowest rank the game engine acknowledges.

### How come I lose a lot of leaders?

A leader can be killed if he is involved in a battle and the current year is his death year. A leader's death year is contained in the leader files. There are a few tools in [utilities](/wiki/Utilities "Utilities") section that can remove the death date, but they will only affect future games, not any saved games you may be playing.

### I have some leaders left but why they are not assigned to armies with no leaders?

Make sure you turn on auto-assign and wait for one day. If it does not work, then one of these scenarios is true:

*   Your remaining leaders have higher leadership capacity than the number of divisions in the army. For example: if you have many generals and no mj. general left, your 1 division armies will not get an auto assigned leader.
*   Your remaining leaders have lower leadership capacity than the number of divisions in the army. For example: if you have many mj. generals but no general left, your 9 division armies will not get an auto assigned leader.

### Why the leader's experience becomes 0 when I promote him?

It is reset to 0 every time you promote the leader. Also note that the leader's skill is reduced by one point as well with a promotion.

### Does the historical promotion date in leader file allow my leader to be auto-promoted at that year?

No, it only determines the starting rank of leaders when the scenario starts.
