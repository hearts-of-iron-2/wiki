#  Production 

###    Why doesn't the build time/cost change when I change ministers or research a new tech? 

Any modifier that affects build time and IC cost, such as a minister
change, an assembly-line tech, or event, has no effect on what is
already in the build queue. New production orders created after the
change will take into account any sort of time/cost modifiers. As of the
1.2 patch in the HoI2:Doomsday expansion, build times and costs do
change.

###    Why do I have a red number in my factory information display? 

A red number indicates you have some [wasted industrial
capacity](/wiki/Wasted_IC "Wasted IC") .
