This mod begins in October of 1934 and features a completely new
technology tree (without historical year), improved AI, new units,
events (over 6000 new events), and new countries (for example:Vatican
city and League of Nations). The technology tree in particular is very
unique, in that it allows players to focus on specialization, and forces
choices in research such as choosing the trade-off of having faster
armor with weaker guns, or better guns but slower armor. In this sense,
every nation is sure to field different units.
