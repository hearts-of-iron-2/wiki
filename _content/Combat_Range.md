### [ Combat Range ]{#Combat_Range .mw-headline}

Combat range is a factor in determining
[positioning](/wiki/Positioning "Positioning") . Each fleet has an
optimum combat range it wants to achieve when entering combat, and if it
achieves surprise it will have a good chance that its positioning will
be high enough to start the battle at that range. For example, Transport
Fleets will have their goal to escape, so their optimum range is 450 km.
If this range is achieved, the transports will be able to retreat
without taking damage. Meanwhile, a CTF needs to be in range for its
planes to strike, and yet out of range of capital ship heavy guns.
Finally, a SAG needs to close distance as much as possible in order to
unleash all its firepower.

Given no surprise on either side, imagine a 15-ship CTF entering battle
against a 30-ship BB SAG, with both fleets led by comparable leaders and
composed of medium tech vessels. Since neither side is advantaged by
surprise, the longest ranged ship on either side will tend to set the
initial engagement distance. That will of course be the CVs whose combat
range will likely be around 180km at medium tech. The next longest
ranged ship is the Super Battleship, which has a range of approximately
40km. That means the BBs will have to close the distance by about 140km
before they can even shoot back, all the while being bombed by the enemy
planes. In HoI2, CVs ruled the seas for this reason, with the only
exception of night battles and bad weather. Starting in Doomsday,
however, balance was restored: with the introduction of light carriers,
it became possible for an SAG with CVLs to close distance.

**Combat Range** in Naval battles has an optimal value. This value is
believed to be calculated as described below

- [CV](/wiki/CV "CV"){.mw-redirect} is the highest class in
  calculating optimal range.
- [Capital Ship](/wiki/Capital_Ship "Capital Ship") or
  [CVL](/wiki/CVL "CVL"){.mw-redirect} is the second highest class in
  calculating optimal range.
- [Screen Ship](/wiki/Screen_Ship "Screen Ship") is the lowest class
  in calulating optimal range.
- **Unique class\'s**
  - [Submarine](/wiki/Submarine "Submarine") ONLY fleets will
    attempt to be at 90% of the maximum range of the shortest range
    submarine
  - [Transport](/wiki/Transport "Transport") ONLY fleets will
    attempt to be at 450+ km and then flee.

**Optimal Range** will always be **90%** of the **maximum** range of the
**shortest** range of the **highest** ship class.

i.e. If you have two [Capital Ship](/wiki/Capital_Ship "Capital Ship")
\'s in a fleet. One with a range of 30 and the other with a range of 28,
the optimal range will be 90% of 28.

_NOTE_ , Range of a lower class is ignored. If you have a [Capital
Ship](/wiki/Capital_Ship "Capital Ship") in a fleet with a range of 28
and the rest of the fleet is [Screen
Ship](/wiki/Screen_Ship "Screen Ship") \'s with ranges of 32 the optimal
range will be 90% of the range of the [Capital
Ship](/wiki/Capital_Ship "Capital Ship") (i.e. 90% of 28) The range of
the [Screen Ship](/wiki/Screen_Ship "Screen Ship") \'s is ignored.
