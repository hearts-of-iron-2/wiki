###    Marine Amphibious Force (MAF) 

A **Marine Amphibious Force** is a limited [Surface Action
Group](/wiki/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") (SAG) with
[Transports](/wiki/Transport "Transport") (TP) attached to it for the
purpose of ferrying troops and executing amphibious assaults. Shore
bombardment will automatically occur during an amphibious assault by all
capable ships in an adjacent sea zone.

**[Amphibious assault](/wiki/Amphibious_assault "Amphibious assault")
mission:** This must be issued when the fleet is already located in its
home port. Otherwise, it will likely result in the entire fleet
returning to its home port. Alternatively, troops can simply disembark
from the transports and attack. This only works for games up to
Armageddon 1.2. For the Armageddon 1.3beta patch, disembarking from
transports into enemy territory is no longer possible. Leaving
transports in the region is important for early assaults, in the event
of defeat or retreat, troops can retreat to the transports.

####  MAF Fleet Composition 

Three philosophies are debated, currently.

1.  *TP-only fleets* : This playstyle argues that TPs should be left in
    TP-only fleets. The reason is that TP-only fleets have a optimal
    [combat
    range](/wiki/index.php?title=Naval_primer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naval primer (page does not exist)")
    of 450+km and then flee. Adding even a single warship will decrease
    this and let the TPs participate in combat, where they can only
    lose.
2.  *CV-protection* : Followers of this idea argue that adding a CV to
    the fleet will put the fleet at a distance to all surface fleets
    that do not contain carriers, thus protecting the TPs better than if
    they are sent out alone.
3.  *Surface fleet* : This is the "old-school" version of a MAF: combine
    your TPs with a sufficiently strong SAG to defend the transports.
