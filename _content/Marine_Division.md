Notes
-----

*   Marine divisions are considered soft units.
*   Marines have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal infantry of the same year.
*   Marines have less penalty performing [amphibious assaults](/wiki/Amphibious_assault "Amphibious assault") (the penalty is reduced even more the further along the tech tree you get) .
*   Marines have less difficulties fighting in marshes and jungles.
