 #### How do I strategically redeploy units?

The following requirements must be satisfied for Strategic Redeployment (SR):

*   Rear Area Supply Dumps (an Infantry tech) is researched.
*   There is a land connection between the current location of division and the target.

Select the unit(s). Hold ctrl + right click in the destination province. For garrisons, a simple right click will do.

*   NOTE: you can not SR thru an ally's territory unless you are at war.

*   NOTE: As a general rule it is longer, in time, to SR one provience distance but shorter, in time, to SR 2 or more proviences away.
