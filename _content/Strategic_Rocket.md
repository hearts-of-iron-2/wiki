The Rocket or Ballistic Missile (e.g. the German V2) is designed to
deliver a payload of explosives to a distant target. Its high speed
makes it almost impossible to intercept but it is an expensive way of
destroying the enemy with conventional explosives. Nuclear weapons are
needed to give it more than psychological effect.
