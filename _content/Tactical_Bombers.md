Tactical Bombers are medium-sized aircraft, larger than Fighters, yet smaller than [Strategic Bombers](/wiki/Strategic_Bombers "Strategic Bombers") , which are used primarily for delivering attacks against enemy ground units such as Armour and Infantry. Unlike close air support aircraft, it is also capable of taking up limited strategic bombardment roles, such as runway cratering or strikes against defensive installations. Although they have a limited dog-fighting capability, they can be easily outmatched by Fighters in air combat.
