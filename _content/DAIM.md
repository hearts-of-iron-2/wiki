 DAIM stands for "Determined AI Modification" and is a mod that solely focuses on improving the AI. This is accomplished by ensuring the AI researches and builds the most effective units possible, rather than wasting time building units that the game engine/AI is not capable of using effectively. Specific focus was made to improve: Germany, Italy, Japan, Great Britain, Soviet Union, U.S.A. and Nationalist China. DAIM can be adapted to other mods, since it only changes a select few AI files.
