This mod extends the tech tree of the game to 1964, the official end
date of Armageddon. While Paradox extended the game time in Armageddon,
they did not add any events or new technologies to fill this gap. The
Cold War Tech Tree Extension Projects aims to do this.

The early tech tree is left untouched, so that it is possible to play a
"normal" 1936 grand campaign game with this mod installed.
