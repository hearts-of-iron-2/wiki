The Aircraft Carrier is rapidly becoming the most important naval
vessel. Its ability to project power through the aircraft it carries
makes it dangerous to other capital ships and land forces. However, the
ship itself is only lightly armed and must rely on other naval units, as
well as its own aircraft, to afford it protection.

##  Carrier Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades allowed 

-   [Carrier Air Group](/wiki/Carrier_Air_Group "Carrier Air Group")

##  Notes 

-   A carrier is considered a capital ship.
-   The base org and morale is 20 for Great War and Early carriers, 25
    for Basic carriers and 30 for all others.
-   A carrier without a carrier air group is just a giant, expensive
    floating piece of metal.
