Before being promoted to the rank of Major General in September, 1939, [Erwin Rommel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel) was first an instructor and then commander of the War Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He is not in the game before 1939 because Major General is the lowest rank the game engine acknowledges.
