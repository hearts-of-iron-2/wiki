, [Mexico](/Mexico "Mexico") , [El
Salvador](/index.php?title=El_Salvador&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Salvador (page does not exist)")
, and
[Honduras](/index.php?title=Honduras&action=edit&redlink=1 "Honduras (page does not exist)")
. The [IC](/IC "IC") is 7, the highest in Central America. You also have
claims on the one-territory country of [El

. Your government is corrupt, ineffective, and full of just plain ole'
bad leaders. Good ministers come at the beginning of WW2.

##  Tips 

-   Upgrade your IC. You *must* have sufficient IC to wage war against
    neighbors, and lower dissent.
-   Push Diplomacy bar to Interventionism. You need less dissent from
    war.
-   No alliances! [Germany](/Germany "Germany") doesn't offer help, and
    the South Americans are completely greedy and will take your
    rightfully earned land.

##    You always remember your first (And second, and third, and fourth) 

###  [El Salvador](/index.php?title=El_Salvador&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Salvador (page does not exist)") 

These guys are a joke. Create a [Militia
division](/Militia_Division "Militia Division") , and invade away. You
may have noticed no partisan activity: They are one of your [national
provinces](/index.php?title=National_province&action=edit&redlink=1 "National province (page does not exist)")
. This works for us! No need to set up a puppet El Salvador, and there
is a full transfer of El Salvadorian IC to you.

###  [Honduras](/index.php?title=Honduras&action=edit&redlink=1 "Honduras (page does not exist)") 

After you receive a nice boost of IC from El Salvador and your
industrial technology, you can create either 2 more militias or a nice
new Infantry division. Whichever one you create, Honduras will fall with
a double attack from Guatemala and [El
Salvador](/index.php?title=El_Salvador&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Salvador (page does not exist)")
. This continues the addition of Rare Materials and energy (which are
pretty sorely needed).

###  Nicaragua and possible U.S. Intervention 

As you may have noticed, The U.S. canceled their Non-Aggression pact
with you. Invest your money in them! Influence, influence and more
frikkin' influence. The U.S. keeps all trade agreements, and even
influences you back if their relation is over +80. This may solve our
problem of U.S. intervention. If the U.S. *does* declare war on us,
there is one thing to do. Fortify by increasing troop presence. Up until
the mid 40's, the bulk of the United States army is Infantry, and
infantry make fairly poor landings, especially on mountain terrains like
Guatemala (and Nicaragua if you have taken it already). Another thing to
remember is the fact that The Canal is in this region. If you're the
risky type, go ahead and build a transport! Then land on Colòn. Faster
than you can say, "The United States offers a white peace"... Er... the
United States offers a white peace. Accept it promptly. If the U.S. is
that concerned, they will have created an alliance with Nicaragua.
This... Well this is not good. But it is important to attack and annex
Nicaragua immediately, otherwise the U.S. lands a pretty sizable force
(by your standards) that is able of skyrocketing up to 5 divisions. Once
Nicaragua is down though, and if the U.S. did remain neutral, you must
influence them after the war until your relations are very good. While
accumulating the money to do this, be sure to increase either your
military or your convoys.

###  [Costa Rica](/index.php?title=Costa_Rica&action=edit&redlink=1 "Costa Rica (page does not exist)") 

These guys are a joke. A half strengthened army, and a possible Air
Force (depending what part of '37-'38 you invade) are no match and they
are overrun immediately. Now you should be increasing your monetary
situations. Influence The U.K. and U.S. Next target: Panama.

###    [Panama](/index.php?title=Panama&action=edit&redlink=1 "Panama (page does not exist)") , more U.S. Intervention, and Canal Trudging 

Panama has a fairly decent navy for a Central American country. But we
aren't attacking with a navy... Here are some things to remember:

-   Panama is... well it's close to the Panama Canal (duh?). The U.S.
    takes great interest in this war, and without a doubt this is the
    war that will push you and your empire closer to annihilation by the
    U.S. then any previous war.
-   There is also the chance that the U.S. wusses out. The Canal can
    cause war or create peace.
-   South America begins land-based military buildup. This does not
    directly affect you but it may later.
-   The U.S. *never* offers the Canal in a peace agreement. If you take
    the Canal, it creates a good to bad scenario. It's like sticking a
    hand in a bees' nest. You get the honey out and it tastes sweet.
    Then the bees attack. This is what the U.S. does. After replaying
    the scenario several times over, I came to the conclusion that
    capturing the Canal is bad, but is completely worth it to achieve an
    independent empire and a strong base of operation. It is your choice
    whether or not you end up taking the Canal or if you choose to avoid
    it altogether.

##    South America, onward! 

[Columbia](/index.php?title=Columbia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Columbia (page does not exist)")
is a nice target. A small army, and small air force won't be a huge
deal. However, you may want to consider
[Ecuador](/index.php?title=Ecuador&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ecuador (page does not exist)")
first. Your supply efficiency has fallen considerably (to 30% in some
cases). Time to land at Guayaquil for supply of South America. One
division should be stationed here, so you can easily put a large amount
of military presence here. If you got
[Colòn](/index.php?title=Col%C3%B2n&action=edit&redlink=1 "Colòn (page does not exist)")
, you can begin buildup of troops on the Columbian border. After Ecuador
is under wraps, invade Columbia! They fall quickly, and there isn't much
dissent. Now lets go after
[Venezuela](/index.php?title=Venezuela&action=edit&redlink=1 "Venezuela (page does not exist)")
. The oil fields at
[Maracaibo](/index.php?title=Maracaibo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Maracaibo (page does not exist)")
are a good first target and make you a nation loved by the dictatorships
of Europe (Finland, Germany, especially Italy). After Venezuela falls,
we turn to the Carribean.

##  The landings at [Cuba](/Cuba "Cuba") and Hispaniola 

Cuba maintains a professional Navy and a small Military (2-3 infantry
divisions). Land as far away from the navy as possible. They will
destroy your transport fleet easily. Once Cuba has been mounted and
defeated, regroup for an invasion of either Haiti or the Dominican
Republic.

###  Hint about Hispaniola 

The Dominican Republic, while more industrialized than its neighbor
Haiti, has a serious tactical flaw. The Dominican Republic has 2
provinces, while Haiti has 1. Any able bodied commander can tell you
that more defense needed can cause a problem in manpower. The D-Day
landings are a perfect example of that. The provinces Santiago and Santo
Domingo are owned the the Republic. Santiago has one Infantry division,
while the city of Santo Domingo has 2-3. You must land at Santiago
first, before Haiti, and before Santo Domingo.

###    Now we're at [Haiti](/index.php?title=Haiti&action=edit&redlink=1 "Haiti (page does not exist)") 

Hopefully you have 4-6 Divisions on the island. Just invade Haiti!

##  The New Guatemalan Empire 

Sounds cool, eh? Now, if you want to, reap the Colonial pigs' Carribean
provinces. Canada will be around and when France falls... join the
Germans. An alliance with a fully secured Empire to the South of The
U.S. may just keep them out of any initial fighting. Hell... Invade
Canada, Mexico, even the U.S.!

[Maracaibo](/index.php?title=Maracaibo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Maracaibo (page does not exist)")
are a good first target and make you a nation loved by the dictatorships
of Europe (Finland, Germany, especially Italy). After Venezuela falls,
we turn to the Carribean.

##  The landings at [Cuba](/Cuba "Cuba") and Hispaniola 

Cuba maintains a professional Navy and a small Military (2-3 infantry
divisions). Land as far away from the navy as possible. They will
destroy your transport fleet easily. Once Cuba has been mounted and
defeated, regroup for an invasion of either Haiti or the Dominican
Republic.

###  Hint about Hispaniola 

The Dominican Republic, while more industrialized than its neighbor
Haiti, has a serious tactical flaw. The Dominican Republic has 2
provinces, while Haiti has 1. Any able bodied commander can tell you
that more defense needed can cause a problem in manpower. The D-Day
landings are a perfect example of that. The provinces Santiago and Santo
Domingo are owned the the Republic. Santiago has one Infantry division,
while the city of Santo Domingo has 2-3. You must land at Santiago
first, before Haiti, and before Santo Domingo.

###    Now we're at [Haiti](/index.php?title=Haiti&action=edit&redlink=1 "Haiti (page does not exist)") 

Hopefully you have 4-6 Divisions on the island. Just invade Haiti!

##  The New Guatemalan Empire 

Sounds cool, eh? Now, if you want to, reap the Colonial pigs' Carribean
provinces. Canada will be around and when France falls... join the
Germans. An alliance with a fully secured Empire to the South of The
U.S. may just keep them out of any initial fighting. Hell... Invade
Canada, Mexico, even the U.S.!
