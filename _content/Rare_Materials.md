title: Rare_Materials

Rare materials represent a classification of industrial materials
essential to wartime production, but no single material being used in
large enough quantities to justify a new category. Such materials
include rubber, sulphates, gold, potash, rare metals like molybdenum,
and other natural and synthetic material.

Each factory will consume one unit of rare materials for every two units
of IC it produces.
