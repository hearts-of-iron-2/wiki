## [ Background ]{#Background .mw-headline}

During the war, France planned to advance into Belgium to create a
static, defensive front not unlike their experience in WWI. The plan
failed when Germany attacked from the Ardennes forest and the French
lacked the mobility and time to respond. You have the chance to avoid
the mistake by making fortresses in northern France or build sufficient
troops to invade Germany when it declares war. Before continuing on,
let's examine France's weaknesses:

-   Bad starting technology
-   Low manpower
-   Low IC
-   Exposed northern front
-   Weak starting army
-   A navy that probably saw service with Napoleon

## [ Technology ]{#Technology .mw-headline}

France will always be able to research more than it can effectively
build with its limited IC. Navy can be entirely ignored. All research
should be primarily poured into Industrial, Infantry, Land Doctrine, and
Armor/Artillery. Air power is useful only for TAC, INT, and possibly
CAS. For this reason, by around 1939 France can be significantly ahead
of all the Allies, including even the USA, in technology research.

-   Industrial: get industry research as high as possible (especially
    the ones which increase manpower, IC, IC efficiency, quicken
    production time and increase research efficiency)
-   Infantry: focus on completing 1941 infantry by May, 1940.
-   Armor: ART, SP-ART, and ARM are useful areas to research.
-   Fighter/interceptor: Research the Interceptor tree, since France
    begins the game with several.

## [ Diplomacy ]{#Diplomacy .mw-headline}

### [ Alliances ]{#Alliances .mw-headline}

France begins the game in the Allies, with the UK as the Alliance
leader. As such, France cannot do anything to alter the alliance save
for leaving it. An ahistorical alternative would be to create a Fascist
France by allying with Germany.

### [ Sliders ]{#Sliders .mw-headline}

France will receive \"free\" interventionism moves to 9, just one short
of full interventionism. France is best moving to Hawk in 1936, 1937,
and 1938. Afterwards, moving to Standing Army is best. Alternatively, a
France that elects a right wing government should make two moves to Free
market in order to gain those excellent bonuses.

### [ Ministers ]{#Ministers .mw-headline}

France begins with some decent ministers, with Social Liberal and Social
Democrat ministers providing the best bonuses throughout the early
years. Generally, IC bonuses are important for France, especially for a
Leftist France. Chief of Staff Lattre de Tassigny (Manpower +25%;
Infantry Construction Bonus -5%) is a good choice. Chief of the Army
Victor Bourgeois is worth considering with his -15% supply consumption
for players who intend to build a large army. As an alternative, Gamelin
provides an -5% infantry construction bonus, in addition to a -10% fort
construction bonus for players who intend to play defensive. Head of
Intelligence Salengro provides +5% IC and +5% steal blueprint.

## [ Intelligence ]{#Intelligence .mw-headline}

France can gain limited benefit through the intelligence system by
stealing blueprints from Germany. Generally, however, it is not
particularly valuable.

## [ Economy ]{#Economy .mw-headline}

### [ Trading ]{#Trading .mw-headline}

France has good resources, and for what it lacks, its Allies will
readily address. For these reasons, France can stockpile all major
materials with no real effort. The UK is a good source for Supplies,
while the USA is a good source for money.

### [ Industrial Production ]{#Industrial_Production .mw-headline}

Early French IC production is not practical, since France begins with
large IC penalties, and requires a large army in order to defend against
Germany. For players who intend a defensive strategy, IC production can
begin as early as around June, 1940, assuming France has established
safe defensive lines. Troop production will always be important in a
defensive war in order to keep pace with Germany, however, so only
limited IC production would be possible. Achieving this balance is
important, since a long defensive war will eventually stretch France\'s
limited TC, thus TC expansion is important.

## [ Military ]{#Military .mw-headline}

France requires complete focus on building a large Army in order to
defend against Germany.

### [ Army ]{#Army .mw-headline}

France must focus considerable effort into building a land force of
infantry and [militia](/wiki/Militia "Militia"){.mw-redirect} capable of
defending France\'s borders against the coming German blitzkrieg. On May
1st, 1940, an Army of around 100 infantry with around 50 militia is
about the minimum necessary for a sound defense. France has a number of
underused troops in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Djibouti. Transport
all of them to the border with Belgium to help the defence. Move all
other troops to the border but leave a limited number of troops on the
Italian border since Italy will likely join Axis. France also requires a
mobile and preferably hard force. ARM with MOT or MEC are useful in
creating holes in defensive German lines, while CAV can be useful for
holes and grabbing territory. Self-propelled Artillery, and to a limited
extent Artillery brigades, will be useful for the limited French forces.

### [ Navy ]{#Navy .mw-headline}

France cannot afford and does not need Naval distractions until Germany
has been successfully repulsed. The Navy is only useful for war with
Italy, and the starting Navy is surprisingly sufficient to this task,
thanks largely to France\'s sole CV.

### [ Air Force ]{#Air_Force .mw-headline}

France cannot afford any serious Air Force production until a defensive
posture against Germany has solidified. As a result, France\'s existing
air force should be better utilized with research focused on TAC and
INT. TAC and possibly CAS can act as very effective force multipliers,
however, and are worthy of consideration especially since France will
inevitably encounter TC overload with over emphasis on ground forces.
TAC is especially useful in an African campaign against Italy, and in
operations behind German defensive lines to clean-up straggler units.

## [ Events ]{#Events .mw-headline}

### [ Elections ]{#Elections .mw-headline}

-   **1936:** In June, 1936, France will have elections. This provides a
    negative 3 dissent, and thus is a good time for changing ministers
    before the event fires. The ministers of the Left are generally the
    best option. A move to the right makes France social conservative.
-   **1938:** In June elections recur. The Left remains a good option,
    retaining Social Democracy. The Social Liberal minister Auriol (+10%
    IC) should be reappointed to Armaments, while the Social Democrat
    Salengro (+5% IC) should be reappointed to Intelligence. A move to
    the right would make France \"Paternal Autocrat\" with limited
    minister choices. When AI France is Paternal Autocrat it\'s very
    likely to declare war on Germany before the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

### [ Spanish Civil War ]{#Spanish_Civil_War .mw-headline}

A few days after the Spanish Civil War begins on July 18, 1936, France
will be asked for intervention. Naturally, sending volunteers is the
best option:

-   Why support anarchists: +10 dissent; +1 isolationism; +1 right
-   Send volunteers: +5 dissent; -200 money; -10 manpower; +2
    interventionism.

Just before the event, you can further move the slider toward
intervention in the diplomacy tab and then guarantee Republican Spain\'s
independence. Then after you go with intervention, if AI Germany
declares war on Republican Spain, it will now have enough belligerence
points for you to declare war on Germany, which is easily defeated in
1936.

## [ War ]{#War .mw-headline}

France has three major strategic postures that can lead to victory:

-   Maginot Defense: Extend Maginot line such that it will extend to the
    border with Belgium and wait.
-   Infantry Defense: Build enough infantry to defend Belgium, and by
    extension, France.
-   Polish Gambit: Invade Germany when it declares war on Poland.

### [ Maginot Defense ]{#Maginot_Defense .mw-headline}

This strategy is the easiest, and probably the most boring. Building and
garrisoning level-10 forts across the division will stop the Germans in
their tracks. Then, one can easily invade and annex Italy, bringing
France\'s IC to a competitive level with Germany\'s. If a breakthrough
cannot be achieved, it\'s simply a matter of waiting until the Soviet
Union declares war on Germany. From that point on, the game is basically
just a race to grab as much territory as possible.

\[ It is entirely possible that the game will become bugged as the war
drags on and all Germany will do is garrison more and more troops along
the Line, and only attack you in Italy. In this case, it may be
necessary to either force the USSR or Germany to declare war on their
respective rivals to get the ball rolling. \]

### [ Infantry Defense ]{#Infantry_Defense .mw-headline}

As an Allied nation with a peacetime modifier penalty, France will not
enter into the war until Danzig on August 30, 1939. Assuming a
reasonably defended Maignot line, however, France will not see actual
combat until May 1, 1940, when Germany invades the low countries.
Generally, France can create a defensive line by rushing north into
Belgium when the war begins. A line can be formed from Ghent to Antwerp
to Namur to Reims. The weakest point of this line is Antwerp owing to a
land border with Eindhoven. Therefore, extending the line to Eindhoven
can be ideal, since France will then be completely protected by rivers.
However, Eindhoven is quite exposed to German envelopment, and thus
requires an army large enough to sufficiently hold both an extended
front and repulse massive attacks against Eindhoven. These tactics also
have the effect of saving both the Netherlands and Belgium.

**Stalemate:** Not surprisingly, a successful defense of Belgium and the
Netherlands will considerably stymy Germany. They will never progress to
an invasion of Yugoslavia or Greece, nor will they ever amass troops on
the Soviet border. As a result, Germany will never launch Operation
Barbarrossa, and Italy will very likely never join the Axis. This can
potentially result in a stalemate that lasts for several years, with
Germany becoming progressively stronger over time due to its much higher
IC. Players seeking this strategy should DOW Italy. Capturing the
Italian peninsula won\'t take longer than a few months, and Northern
Italy/Southern Germany offer strong defensive positions in the Alps.
This will have the effect of creating a static defensive front once
again with Germany. This time, however, France is a bit more powerful
owing to Italian IC.

**Breakthrough:** Alternatively, France can attempt to bust through
German lines. This must be done immediately after France has
successfully created a defensive line, preferably by June, 1940. A
Breakthrough will focus on a region with a relatively small German
force, punching through with an ARM, MOT, and CAV force, with INF
staggering behind in order to shore up captured province defenses. Once
a breakthrough is completed, immediate exploitation of German rear areas
is critical, including a swift drive to Berlin.

### [ Polish Gambit ]{#Polish_Gambit .mw-headline}

From the beginning of 1936, begin researching 1939 Infantry. Research
should finish around 1938: before that time churn out any non-infantry
units needed. Ignore building up an air force or a navy: your allies
should provide you with air cover, and the starting French navy is good
enough for its limited uses. Avoid development into expensive fields
like tanks, as these will chew up France\'s limited IC. Instead,
concentrate production in IC creation. By the time research into 1939
infantry finishes, you should have around 100 base IC. Once research
into 1939 infantry is complete, immediately begin production of at least
12 serial runs of infantry. Group these infantry divisions into the two
provinces on the German border, Strasbourg and Mulhouse. When the war
rolls around with the German invasion of Poland you should have around
100 infantry divisions concentrated in those provinces. Attack
immediately while the German army is preoccupied in Poland. You should
be able to steamroll through the country with little resistance, and
Berlin should fall by 1940.

## [ Gaming the System ]{#Gaming_the_System .mw-headline}

The most prominent use of [gamey
tactics](/wiki/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") for France is to remove
the peacetime IC penalty through an early war. Attacking Nationalist
Spain, as an example, would be one method to do this.

### [ Japanese Ally ]{#Japanese_Ally .mw-headline}

In a single player game, the main drawback of France is low IC. There is
a way to gain a lot of IC in the beginning of the game: ally with Japan
and use its war against China to conquer a lot of Chinese territory,
then leave the alliance and fight along the Allies.

In order to do that, France needs to:

-   get really friendly with Japan: use you fairly large amout of cash
    to influence it up to 200.
-   move the entire French army to Indochina\... it takes a lot of time
    but around 1937 it should be done. Yes mainland France is
    unprotected, but it is still a peaceful time in old Europe.
-   move your slider toward the \"interventionism\" policy\... it\'s
    important beacause the starting level does NOT allow you to leave
    alliances or to join new ones\...
-   when the war breaks in China, leave the alliance with the British
    and ask to join the Japanese aliiance. If you have a 200
    relationship they will accept.
-   attack from the South and, as fast as you can, move North to get the
    interesting provinces (your 3 cavalery division and you 2 light
    armored divisions are very useful for this. The Chinese army
    shouldn\'t be a real problem (use encirclement and destroy their
    armies).

If the things go well, by 1938 French IC could be as high as 120. In
addition, wartime allows you to divert IC from consumers\' good to unit
building. Then a good idea is to stay in war the longer you can. But
don\'t forget to transport your troops back home! Also it may be
preferable to leave the alliance with Japan before they attack the USA
(but a war against the british is what the french await since
Waterloo\... so why not?). If you are at war with Germany the British
will propose you to join the Allied, but if it is not the case they will
refuse. So if Germany never declared war at you you may have to do it in
order to join the Allied (the main purpose is to get their blueprints
and to get wartime bonus).

Don\'t forget that in the Far East you have a nearly undefended border
with Japan. Sooner or later they will enter in a war with the USA (and
therefore with you), and march to the south. The main weak point of the
japanese is that their armies are slow (mainly infantery divisions).
With relatively few motorized, armored and mechanized divisions you can
beat them in China by encircling and destroying them. A few divisions in
the north indochina\'s jungle will stop the japanese, allowing you to
counter-attack when the motorized renforts arrive. But you need a decent
navy to transport them there : start to build carriers early, and chose
Saigon as a port to unload the troops (southern, then less vunerable
than Hanoi to japanese attack). Naval bomber are also a good idea. Take
every continental province of Japan : you IC should reach 200. It may be
time to attack Germany with a little more chances of success\...
