##  Overview 

As a minor power, Portugal is fairly weak. Yet, Portugal is quite unique
in that it can be friends with the world: it is able to join any
alliance in the game.

##  Technology 

Portugal has very limited Technology options. The first priority is to
achieve the second technology slot, possible with Basic Machine Tools,
early annexations, and some IC building. Infantry technology should also
be an early focus.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

Portugal has a large amount of options in terms of Alliances:

-   Portugal can join the Axis as early as the start of the game. Too
    early an alliance with Germany may complicate early adventurism in
    annexations. An Axis alliance can provide opportunities for resource
    gains in Central and South Africa, though very difficult to manage.
-   Portugal can also join Japan. This is possible during the war with
    China, and could provide Portugal with an opportunity to make gains.
-   Portugal can work very hard, with influence actions, to be able to
    join the Allies. This is not entirely easy due to Portugal's
    inability to generate cash. With relations of +200 with the UK,
    Portugal's chances of being accepted into the Allies is 95%. When in
    the Allies, adventures in Ethiopia or Thailand are possible.

###  Sliders 

If Portugal will expand early in the game, slider moves to hawk are
best. If going the isolationist route, moving to Central Planning is
more appropriate.

###  Ministers 

Portugal's starting Ministers are better than average for a minor power.
Depending on the player's strategy (expansionist versus isolationist),
Minister of Security Mario Pais Sousa (-3% IC) should be replaced with
Lucas (-5% consumer goods need) or Melo (Foreign IC +10%). Chief of
Staff Bastos provides a much needed +25% manpower growth bonus.

##  Economy 

###  Trading 

Portugal begins the game with Energy and Metal shortages, thus trading
with supplies is a necessity.

###  Industrial Production 

Building a limited amount of IC can help Portugal to attain a second
research slot. IC building beyond this is not helpful, since Portugal
needs to devote all of its meagre resources to building a military.

##  Military 

A general key to Portugal's military campaigns is the use of convoy
transports: Portugal needs a relatively large convoy fleet in order to
project its military power overseas.

###  Army 

Nearly the entire officer corps of Portugal is old guard. Portugal will
have to rely on Infantry and Militia in order to field a decent army.

###  Navy 

Portugal's navy is quite weak, and only very minor expansion is possible
to defend against other Minor power's navies.

###  Air Force 

Portugal begins the game with a single TAC bomber. Expansion is
generally unthinkable.

##  War 

As a very weak starting country, Portugal has very few options:

-   Ireland: Beginning with just a single division, Ireland's weakness
    and proximity makes it a good target for early war.
-   Spanish Civil War: Portugal is nowhere near powerful enough to face
    the main combatants of the Spanish Civil War. Opportunism, however,
    is a possibility. Portutgal can prey on the loosing side, and
    attempt to grab one of their IC rich territories (La Corona, for
    example) before they are annexed. Capturing an enemy capital
    province will be a relative boon for Portugal's anemic stockpiles.
-   Thailand: A very tough opponent, but a possible target from the
    Macao naval base.
