## [ Gameplay Balancing ]{#Gameplay_Balancing .mw-headline}

### [ Diplomatic ]{#Diplomatic .mw-headline}

-   Coups now have a much bigger chance to actually succeed.
-   Now a puppet can\'t invite his master to an alliance.
-   Now you will get a dissent hit when liberating a puppet.
-   You now recieve a boost of 2 steps on interventonism instead of 1
    whenever someone atacks someone you guarantee.

### [ Common Military ]{#Common_Military .mw-headline}

-   Larger nations in the same alliance will now take control over
    provinces as they invade allies occupied overseas territories, to
    maintain coherent supplied fronts.
-   Fixed so that when you liberate a province occupied by your enemy,
    while you not have access with the original owner, then you take
    control over it directly.
-   Fixed a loophole that allowed someone to immediately deploy
    divisions that are in delayed strat-redeploy.
-   Rebalanced settings for partisans and transport capacity.
-   Whenever a new model is researched, the older models are
    automatically scrapped, this is of course not valid for fleets.
-   Minister research modifiers for technology is now applied.
-   Its no longer possible to scout radar/rocket/nuke sites by just
    clicking on an enemy province.

### [ Land ]{#Land .mw-headline}

-   Due to fun exploits units in strat redeployment are now deployed
    back to where they came from if possible, or the closest controlled
    province from that position. These units also drop out to the
    closest possible place as soon as the target is overrun.
-   Brigades can now be assigned to units in provinces that have the
    same owner as the owner of the unit.
-   The chance for a Encirclement or Breakthrough will now be happen 10%
    more often for every 1 km/h over 3 km/h. There is a cap on 40%.
-   Units retreating to enemy-controlled territory with enemy units in
    both target and source province will now be eliminated.
-   Reduced the toughness of more advanced infantry models somewhat.
-   Raised the toughness values of the earlier MOT divisions to
    generally be 2 points above their equivalent regular INF
    counterparts.
-   Softness of MOT & MEC divisions now decreases when models get more
    advanced.
-   Doubled the movement & attack penalties in frozen & mud conditions.
-   Supply & fuel usage of brigades is now 40% of the old values.
-   Heavy Armor and Super Heavy Armor brigades are now allowed to be
    attached to INF (if you\'re stupid enough :p)
-   Manpower requirement for Mountaineers and Marines changed from 10 to
    15, like Paras already had (-\> elite troops)
-   Buildtime for Mountaineers, Marines and Paratroopers increased by 30
    days
-   Tech difficulty of Mountaineer, Marines and Paratrooper techs
    increased by 1 (5 to 6)
-   Edited the Engineer brigade as follows: MP need from 2.0 to 2.5,
    lowered their speed bonus from 1 to 0.5 and added a small
    fuelconsumption of 0.2 to them. This keeps them a very strong
    brigade but less of a no-brainer.
-   Edited the tech tree of mtn, par & mar a bit and fixed a bug there
-   Lowered the MP requirement for garrisons

### [ Naval ]{#Naval .mw-headline}

-   Made a full overhaul of CV & CAG balance.
-   Tweaked the CL subattack values to 1-1-2-2-3-4 in that order of
    appearance
-   Tweaked the DD ranges to be the same as the various CL ranges
-   Fixed a bug in the range for Nuclear Battlecruisers
-   Lowered air defence of submarines somewhat
-   Lowered speed for 36 & 39 infantry by one point (5-\>4).
-   Research difficulty of legged division types raised by 1 across the
    board.
-   Research difficulty for most brigades dropped by 2 across the board.

### [ Air ]{#Air .mw-headline}

-   Only airunits on air-superiority mission will now attempt to engage
    other airunits in the same province.
-   Increased effect from interdiction by 66%.
-   Starting efficiency of AA is now 10%.
-   Reduced the effcts of Static AA improvements
-   Rewrote targeting algoritms for ground attack and interdiction, to
    focus on combats as much as possible.
-   Air battle XP gain lowered from 2.25 to 2
-   Reduced the cost of transport_planes a tiny bit.
-   Lowered the naval attack ratings of naval bombers by 3 for each
    model.
-   Gave CAS the same naval attack value as their equivalent naval
    bomber models, with a correction of -2. So if a NAV has a NA of 9,
    the equivalent CAS has 7.
-   Gave TAC a +2 boost to their strategic attack rating.
-   Raised the cost for flying bombs and flying rockets (2 IC for bomb,
    3 for the first two rockets, 4 for the ICBM)
-   Tweaked the starting efficiency of AA batteries downward, their
    efficiency now increases exponentially when more advanced AA
    batteries become available.
-   Raised Soft and Hard Attack values on CAS by 2,2,3,3 over the
    various levels. CAS gets an additional 1 point in Hard Attack at
    Improved and Advanced models.
-   Naval stacking penalty is now applied properly versus air-units
    bombing them as well.

### [ Economical ]{#Economical .mw-headline}

-   A puppet now has a max-pool of 1000 instead of 100 in resources.
-   Now it is possible to build coastal fort, land fort, anti air,
    infrastructure, airbase, naval base, radar station, nuclear reactor,
    rocket test site, and factory in occupied territories.
-   Tweaked a lot of techteams, leaders & ministers.
