Fighters are the backbone of any air force. They are used to achieve air superiority against enemy bombers and fighters They are all-rounders, being able to fulfill any mission given to them, but excelling at none in particular.

## Brigades allowed

- None

## Notes

- They have moderate range, have the best air attack capability (without bonuses), and can be effective against ground targets. Their primary role is achieving air superiority: destroying enemy fighters and denying airspace to enemy bombers.

- While a specialized air force is ideal, these craft are all-rounders. [Interceptors](/wiki/Interceptors "Interceptors") are superior at bomber interception (due to a bonus). If research or production choices are tight, develop the fighter first, as Interceptors need two additional techs before they can be upgraded to the turbojet version.

- In a ground attack role, note that the hard attack capability of fighters is particularly high, comparable to that of [CAS](/wiki/CAS "CAS") and [TAC](/wiki/index.php?title=TAC&action=edit&redlink=1 "TAC (page does not exist)") bombers. After air superiority has been achieved, fighters are ideal for giving bombing runs an extra punch against armoured targets. These units can also be effective against soft targets, but to a lesser extent.
