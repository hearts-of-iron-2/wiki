# Other parts of 1945

- according to official CPC stats, at the end of the war against japan, the communists had a regular army of 930 000 men and an organized militia of some 2 200 000 (1.253)

Above statistics lacked substantiation as a result of the defeat of the Nationalist Regime in 1949. At the time Japan surrendered, the Chinese communist party was entrenched in Rectification Movement 1942-1945 as well as a party congress for power consolidation. Only American planes from Dixie Mission saved the communist cause by flying out commanders. The exact number, which was also recorded by Russians, did not exceed 300,000-400,000 troops for the communist New Fourth Army and Eight Route Army combined. Even after the expansion of troops in Manchuria, the total headcount did not exceed 500,000 by Nov 1945 when the Nationalist Army began the deployment toward the northeastern territory.

Complete reorganization of the army (1.195)

Alpha Program

- 39 divisions would be trained and equipped
  - train 500 000 Chinese troops
  - 300 000 will be armed soldiers
- if completed, this plan would have affected approximately 1/6th of the entire Chinese regular army as reorganized
- the plan was fully realized for only 12 as far as equipment was concerned

(Source: [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) )

- Militarily, Mao Tse-tung agreed to compress to 48 and consecutively 43 divisions, so that communist forces would be amounting to 1/6th and consecutively 1/7th the size of 263 KMT divisions. Chiang Kai-shek stated that they intended to compress the army to 120 divisions, but communists refused to lower to 20 divisions.

- 94th Corps
  - 5th Div commanded by Li Zefen

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) ) In Manchuria, the forces were:

- New 1st Corps commanded by Zheng Dongguo
- New 6th Corps
- 52nd Corps
- 71st Corps commanded by Liang Huashen

Also the Yunnanese 60th and 92nd corps were coming to Manchuria

## Nov-Dec 1945

On 27 November 1945 General George Marshall began his efforts to mediate a solution to the Chinese civil war. General Marshall arrived in China in December 1945 with the hope of brokering a cease-fire between the KMT and the CCP, and of building a coalition government that would include all of the contending political/military groups in China.

# 1946

- Two major campaigns occurred in early 1946 in east and west Manchuria. To the east, government troops recovered the territories of Western Liaoning Province and Jehol \[excluding Chifeng and Chengde\]; and to the east, government troops routed Lin Biao's communist troops at the Battle of Shaling. A respite ensued till Russians suddenly pulled out of Manchuria beginning from March 1946 when George Marshal took off for America, which was very much a calculated event. Government troops then hastily marched north to recover Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin, but encountered stiff communist resistance along the China Eastern Railway. Fightings centered around the railway nexus of Sipingjie for one and half a month.
- "Dian-jun", the Yunnanese army, designated the 184th Division, of the 50th corps, defected to the Communists in Haiching, Liaoning Province on May 29th. The defection included only one regiment and the division command center. The majority of the defector troops, on a later occasion, fled a north-bound train and re-joined the Nationalist Army to be Re-organized 184th Division.

# 1947

- On March 13, Hu Zongnan led a 140 000 strong army against Yan'an and took over the empty city as popular history textbooks claimed. The historical truth, however, shows that Hu Zongnan's actual fighting force consisted of two re-organized Corps or about six re-organized divisions, with a fighting force of about 18 re-organized brigades at varying size of 5000-7000 per brigade. On the cmmunist side, the army at Yenan consisted of about 120,000-150,000 regular troops and military district troops.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) )

- Also in march, Communist forces under Chen Yi, after suffering a serious defeat at the hands of a Guangxi army column (consisting of the 7th and 48th corps),, seized the opportunity to destroy one of the best US equipped army corps (74th) of the central army at Mengliangkan , killing the commander, Zhang Ningfu (1.252)

- On May 14th, Su Yu forced Zhang Lingfu onto Mt Menglianggu, Shandong Province by encircling KMT Reinforced 74th Division (i.e., originally Yu Jishi's 74th Corps) with 5 echelons and cutting off KMT relief armies with another 4 echelons. On May 16th, 100,000 communist forces totally destroyed 32,000 KMT forces, with a casualty of 12,000 on the communist side

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) )

- early in the year, several military commands were set up (1.246):

  - north China Command led by Fu Zuoyi
  - central China command led by Bai Chongxi
  - northwest China command led by Ma Bufang
  - although they were honored with major commands, none was entrusted with important authority in the central military establishment

### Sept

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) ) On the evening of Sept 17th 1948 (Oct 1st per Jung Chang's "Wild Swans"), CCP forces sacked Yixian county, to the north of Jinzhou, and destroyed KMT 93rd Corps plus one cavalry column, totalling 10,000 men. Fan Hanjie's forces in Jinzhou city were hence surrounded by CCP forces on all sides. \[...\] Meantime, Chiang Kai-shek air-lifted 49th Corps to Jinzhou for assistance with city defence. Jinzhou was said to have been cut off from outside world by Sept 26th.

### October

"despite the basic soundness of his order for simultaneous attacks from Mukden and Changchun in order to effectuate the breakout of government force from Changchun, his commands were not obeyed in full. General Wei Lihuang's force did not lash out from Mukden in full strength. In despair, one of the garrison units, the 60th Army (Yunnanese) revolted and turned its guns on the loyal New 7th Army. The latter, a parly American trained force, was the backbone of the city's defense forces. On the 20th of the month, Changchun and its starving defenders fell into communist hands." (1.259)

On the night of Oct 17th, Zeng Zesheng's 60th Corps declared an uprising for the communist camp, and cut Changchun city into two parts.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) ) On Oct 20th, Du Yuming and Wei Lihuang flew back to Shenyang, with order that Liao Yaoxiang's Army Group, with an addition of 207th Division of 6th Corps, attack Heishan and that Liu Yuezhang's 52nd Corps attack Yingkou for securing the withdrawal route of Liao Yaoxiang. Secretly, Wei Lihuang instructed Shenyang garrison division chief Wang Lihuan in guaranteeing the peaceful transfer of Shenyang and its 2 million citizens to CCP.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar) ) Liao Yaoxiang's army group, the heroes of Burma, were destroyed by the Communists by October 28th

"Fu Zuoyi, commander of North China, concentrated his main force int he Beiping-Tianjin area for a decisive battle, counting upon a communist regrouping period of at least one and a half months before Red general Lin Biao could move his army into the Great Wall.
