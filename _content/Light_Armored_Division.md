title: Light_Armored_Division
---

Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks become heavier, their speeds will reduce accordingly. They also require a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field and if this vital supply is severed, the armoured unit will be almost useless.

_Light armored divisions upgrade to basic medium armor divisions. The advanced light armor tech allows you to build a light armor brigade which can be added to almost every kind of division._
