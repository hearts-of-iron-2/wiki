## [ Operation Downfall: Strategy for the Allies ]{#Operation_Downfall:\_Strategy_for_the_Allies .mw-headline}

The main way to beat this scenario is to hack slowly away at the
Japanese possessions. By this I mean first take the southern part of the
Korean peninsula (if you play as the Allies, the USSR should handle
this). Next, go for Taiwan. All during this time, by the way, you should
be using all of your planes to bomb Japanese positions everywhere.

Next, make sure the Japanese southern most island, which consists of 2
provinces, is secure. To do this, land 5 or so divisions of the southern
province. Deafeat the troops there, then transport in 10 more divisions.
Then, take the northern province.

Take care of the northern most island next. Use the same strategy as
above. The only difference is leave a garrison in the southern province
because the Japanese can reach that province.

Now it\'s time to attack the main island. I suggest landing at Hiroshima
with 10 divisions. Once you establish a beach head, advance towards the
province next to Hiroshima. Speed is crucial in this situation, because
it will be difficult to defeat Japan if they\'re dug in.

During this time, launch an amphibious invasion of the north section of
the island. This will catch the Japanese off guard, and you should have
an easy victory now. Just capture Tokyo, and you\'ve won!
