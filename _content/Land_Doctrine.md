##  Doctrine Overview 

**Land Doctrine** effects:

-   Organisation and [Morale](/wiki/Morale "Morale") values
-   [HQ Unit](/wiki/HQ_Units_in_Action "HQ Units in Action")
    availability and effectiveness
-   Production costs of certain units (only patch 1.2 and newer; they do
    not function in 1.1)
-   Combat Events
-   Some Night/Terrain modifiers

There are 6 Doctrine trees available in the game, depending on tech
choices.

-   Mobility Focus - Spearhead (finishes in Volksturm Doctrine or Modern
    Blitzkrieg)
-   Mobility Focus - Human Wave (finishes in Mechanized Wave)
-   Firepower Focus - Superior Firepower (branches on the last tech into
    Mechanized Offensive or Combined Arms Defence) finished at Air Land
    Battle.
-   Firepower Focus - Grand Battle Plan, which branches in 1941 into:
    -   Attritional Containment
    -   Infiltration Assault
    -   Operational Stages
    -   Grand Battle Plan finishes at Assault Concentration Doctrine.

##  Doctrine Summaries 

Each of the doctrines have their own strengths and weaknesses which are
detailed out below. The choice of which one you would be best to adopt
is should be determined by a number of factors such as:

1\. What type of game you want to play;

2\. How far at the start of a scenario you are already along a certain
doctrine path (for example, in the 1944 scenario, it would be
significantly counter-productive for Germany to change its doctrine
path);

3\. The relative 'matching' of your tech teams with you preferred
doctrine path (for example, German tech teams are better matched to
[research](/wiki/Research "Research") the Blitzkrieg path, and less so
the others);

4\. If playing a minor, what a major ally might be able to offer in
terms of blueprints (for example, Hungary starts on the US Superior
Firepower path, but if played normally, would usually ally with Germany
on the Blitzkrieg path - switching to this doctrine might be
worthwhile);

5\. The 'difficulty' of the path undertaken. Note that Firepower path
only has 9 techs to research, whilst mobility has 10. Further note that
the Grand Battle Plan difficulty is only 9 per stage, compared to 10 for
the other three (the other exception is the Human Wave, the last two are
both 8);

6\. When you are intending to enter the war.

###  Spearhead 

The Spearhead doctrine tree is exceptionally strong, particularly
between 1937 and 1941. It has extremely high organisation, fast
headquarters units, cheap tanks, and Breakthrough and Encirclement
offensive [combat events](/wiki/Combat_Events "Combat Events") . Most of
the benefits are achieved by 1940, giving early advantages.

Between 1939 and 1942 there are also cost savings on infantry and
artillery; in 1943 these are switched to motorised and mechanised troops
and self-propelled guns.

Spearhead doctrine is ideally suited to nations who are seeking to
conduct rapid Blitzkrieg offensives. The high Organisation levels mean
that the troops are very good at winning battles and sustained
operations. The only disadvantage is that some other nations have better
cost reductions, and defensive combat events are scarce.

Neither of the late war techs are very good however. Volkssturm,
available by 1944 (the earliest of the late/post war techs) offers
discounts to milita and urban defence at the expense of a 10%
organisation penalty to infantry. The Modern Blitzkrieg doctrine, whilst
offering a 5% org increase, isn't available till 1947 and doesn't offer
as much as the other tech trees do.

###  Human Wave 

The Human Wave doctrine tree has low Organisation throughout but
exceptional Morale. At every stage the Morale is higher than any other
type. Higher morale allows organization to recover much faster, meaning
that units can recover organization and quickly attack again.

There are significant discounts to Infantry and Cavalry throughout,
biggest in 1940 and the first two of three 1941 land doctrines. Starting
with the last 1941 land doctrine, there are discounts for Motorised,
Mechanized and Armoured units. HQs are initially slow until the last
1941 Land Doctrine is researched and give virtually no Supply Efficiency
bonus until 1943. One of the difficulties of the Human Wave land
doctrine tree is that you need to research one 1940 and then three 1941
land doctrines consecutively while the German Blitzkrieg branch has only
one 1941 Land Doctrine.

The combat events focus on Assaults and Counterattacks, which trade your
manpower for enemy organisation.

Human Wave doctrine suits nations which have plenty of Manpower to make
lots of Infantry units which throw themselves at the enemy on the
offensive or the defensive. The initially slow HQ speed means an
operational attack is relatively slow and needs careful planning. With
the later doctrines, however, HQ speed increases significantly.

The 1946 tech 'Mechanised Wave' does offer huge bonuses (30%) to armour
and mechanised unit morale.

###  Superior Firepower 

Organisation and Morale are initially both very poor. Superior Firepower
organisation is worse than even the Human Wave's until 1941, but almost
catches up with Spearhead in 1943.

However, the Superior Firepower tech tree has discounts on Infantry that
are just as big as the Human Wave tech tree. Artillery brigades are also
heavily discounted. Later this switches to Motorised, Mechanised
divisions and SP Guns.

The other notable feature is that this tree has the highest Supply
Efficiency bonus from the presence of HQ units.

The Superior Firepower doctrine tree suits countries that are entering
the war late. Early on their armed forces are very disorgansied and
vulnerable. This doctrine also encourages an Artillery focus, whether
static or mobile.

The 1946 tech 'Air-Land Battle' finally gives a 10% boost to both
Organisation and Morale, with a cost reduction for Cavalry (presumably
for the upcoming helicopter unit).

###  Grand Battle Plan 

This doctrine line is superior right at the beginning, in 1936 - but is
outclassed almost immediately. (Note that Germany starts the '36
scenario with many advanced techs).

These doctrines give poor organisation and morale and slight discounts
to infantry and AT guns.

They improve somewhat in 1942-44 as the tech tree splits:

-   Attritional Containment: Achieves relatively high morale levels and
    low organisation. Respectable discounts on Infantry, AT, Engineers
    and Artillery. Combat events are the Assault and the Counterattack.
    Mainly suitable for static defense or slow attack.
-   Infiltration assault: Very high Morale, though both Org and Morale
    are always lower than the Soviet tech tree. This tree gives
    advantages to night combat, which generally makes your land units
    more effective. Plenty of Ambush combat events. Discounts on
    Infantry, Marines and Militia. Armour becomes more expensive.
    Encourages to an extent an offensive Infantry and Militia focus.
-   Operational Stages: Balanced between Org and Morale and mediocre at
    both - ends up in 1944 equivalent to where the Germans were in 1941.
    Discounts end up spread over Infantry, Mechanized, Motorised,
    Anti-Tank and Armour. Not a strong tech tree but the only way to
    shift the Grand Battle Plan decision around to mechanised warfare.

The 1946 addition 'Assault Concentration' adds 20% morale and
organisation to any divisions with an artillery brigade, making the
addition of these brigades to units very worthwhile.

##  Rankings 

While all doctrines have particular strengths and weaknesses, a general
table can be constructed showing the value of doctrines relative to each
other. The top three doctrines switch places, but always remain in the
top three: Blitzkrieg, Human Wave, and Infiltration.

###  1936- 1942 

1.  Blitzkrieg
2.  Human Wave
3.  Infiltration/Operational/Attritional (identical)
4.  Superior Firepower

###  1942 - 1943 

1.  Infiltration
2.  Human Wave
3.  Blitzkrieg (best only if outnumbered or on the defensive)
4.  Superior Firepower (with tech rush)
5.  Operational Stages
6.  Attritional Containment

###    1944+ 

1.  Infiltration
2.  Human Wave
3.  Blitzkrieg
4.  Superior Firepower
5.  Attritional Containment
6.  Operational Stages

###  Comparison of final results 

Doctrine: (Org)/(Morale) Superior Firepower: 70/50 Human Wave: 40/110
Blitzkrieg: 75/50 Operational Stages: 55/50 Infiltration Assault: 40/100
Attritional Containment: 45/75

Note - The maximum organisation can actually vary from unit to unit,
even within the same doctrine path, by quite some degree, due to
domestic sliders (Full standing army provides 10% org bonus, whilst full
drafted army has a 10% negative), brigade attachments and specialist
infantry.

As an example, with all techs researched in the Infiltration Assault
path, a unit could have as little as 63 Org (normal unit, full drafted
slider) or as much as 110 Org (Specialist infantry with Artillery
brigade attached with full standing army slider).
