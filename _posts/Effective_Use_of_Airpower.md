##  Overview 

Aircraft in Hearts of Iron 2 are extremely powerful when used
effectively: they can decimate enemy Navies *and* destroy enemy Armies.
An **effective use of airpower** requires a considerable amount of
research and aircraft construction: half-hearted attempts to create an
air force will not be effective.

There are four types of bombers in HOI2:

-   [Tactical
    Bombers](/index.php?title=Tactical_Bomber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tactical Bomber (page does not exist)")
    (TAC)
-   [Strategic
    Bombers](/index.php?title=Strategic_Bomber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Strategic Bomber (page does not exist)")
    (STR)
-   [Naval Bombers](/Naval_Bomber "Naval Bomber") (NAV)
-   [Close Air Support](/Close_Air_Support "Close Air Support") (CAS)

There are three types of fighters in HOI2:

-   [Fighters](/Fighter "Fighter") (FTR)
-   [Escort Fighters](/Escort_Fighter "Escort Fighter") (ESC)
-   [Interceptors](/Interceptor "Interceptor") (INT)

Finally, in a category of its own, there is the [Transport
Planes](/index.php?title=Transport_Plane&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transport Plane (page does not exist)")
(TRA). For technology requirements for these, see the
[Aircraft_Tech_Tree](/Aircraft_Tech_Tree "Aircraft Tech Tree") .

###  Version Changes 

-   HOI2: Air combat in the original HOI2 game was considerably flawed.
    The AI would send aircraft on suicide missions, and literally waste
    its most valuable aircraft for no tactical nor strategic gain.
    Meanwhile, Naval Bombers were ridiculously overpowered and could
    single handedly wipe out entire navies.
-   DD: Air combat AI was significantly improved. Escort fighters became
    brigades. Naval Bombers were weakened.
-   ARMA: Air combat AI was again improved. Aircraft take much more
    damage by enemy fire than in previous versions of the game. That
    means more micromanagement as you really don´t want your planes to
    attack larger enemy stacks.

##  Strategy 

This diversity of options makes it nearly impossible for any nation to
master all aircraft technologies, or build sufficient quantities of
aircraft in all fields. Therefore, it is necessary to choose areas of
specialization, contingent on your overall war strategy. Two sets of
aircraft share technology doctrines, making them popular choices:
Fighters and Interceptors; and Tactical and Naval Bombers.

For major nations, the choice in Bombers is divided three ways, and
*only two options* can effectively be pursued. Most players choose
TAC/NAV & CAS, and ignore STR:

-   Tactical & Naval Bombers
-   Close Air Support Bombers
-   Strategic Bombers

###  Airfields 

Building CAS, TRA, or FTR aircraft is typically best served by building
new airfields near expected fronts for the aircraft to be useful beyond
the initial front early in the war. Germany, for example, must build up
the Polish border provinces to house CAS aircraft prior to Fall Weiss.
Building up along the frontier of the Low Countries and France will
allow Germany to use CAS as an integral part of the attack, shortening
battles, speeding up conquests, and in the end reserving manpower and
organization for more rapid movement around the end of the Maginot line.
The Soviet Union has a severe lack of airbases, and requires
considerable construction efforts to create an effective infrastructure
for air power.

###  Air Defense 

A total of five factors can be used to provide an extremely strong air
defense:

-   Interceptor "umbrella": Interceptors on Air Superiority missions
    covering each major interior region of your nation.
-   Fighter "barrier": Fighters on Air Superiority missions that provide
    a defensive "front-line".
-   Anti-Aircraft: To assist fighters and interceptors, anti-aircraft
    installations are very effective
-   Air Bases: Any air engagement over an airbase provides your aircraft
    with combat bonuses
-   Radar: Any air engagement over an airbase provides your aircraft
    with combat bonuses

###  Air Superiority 

Air Superiority is not merely a defensive tactic. While extreme
defensive measures can be successful in achieving air superiority,
offensive measures can produce the same or better results. Considering
that the intent of Air Superiority is to remove your enemy's ability to
put aircraft in the air at all, offensive operations are necessary. This
requires a coordinated effort by your air forces to not only repel enemy
aircraft, but also damage the enemy's infrastructure for those aircraft.
This is important because most air combat (in DD & ARMA) will only
reduce the org and cause slight damage to attacking aircraft. Those
aircraft will then retreat in order to repair. Actual destruction of
aircraft is quite difficult and rare (in DD & ARMA).

Strategic bombers are the best weapon for attacking enemy
infrastructure, and perform three vital missions:

-   Installation strikes to reduce the effect of AA;
-   Runway cratering to reduce the strength of airfields;
-   Logistical strikes to reduce province infrastructure -- which means
    airfields and AA will take longer to come back to normal.

Once air superiority has been achieved, periodic Strategic Bombing runs
are necessary to maintain supremacy. This method, though expensive, can
be used to achieve complete air dominance over an enemy.

###  Strategic Examples 

Germany: As a nation, Germany relies upon the strength of their ground
forces, very specifically their armor and fast attacks, to conquer
territory and integrate it quickly into their war machine to fuel
further conquests. A large STR force is absolutely antithetical to this
approach. Reducing infrastructure and IC of provinces you're going to
conquer slows your advance and lengthens the amount of time it takes to
integrate the province into your empire's production machine. The clear
choice for Germany is CAS/TAC.

Great Britain: Having the sea as a wall, Great Britain is in a position
that massive land combats are not to be expected. Until the aid of the
United States comes into the war, the UK will not be able to win an
extended land campaign against a Germany set to defend against it. The
best defense of the Home Islands is making certain that Germany cannot
mount an attack. Being dependent upon overseas sources for your
industrial materials means that you will be vulnerable if the Germans
should cut your supply lines. Large land forces garrisoning all the
possible landing beaches in Great Britain can be hard on your TC,
leaving your overseas holdings vulnerable to conquest. Shutting down the
immediate threat of Germany is your number one goal. TAC/STR is clearly
the choice for Great Britain.

##  Tactics 

Ultimately, the Air Force is only useful to the extent that it assists
in the broader war effort, which generally means capturing provinces. In
the land war, a complete/ideal use of the air force would be conducted
like this:

-   An Interceptor wing flies over your own forces, protecting them from
    enemy bombers
-   A fighter wing flies over enemy territory, attacking enemy
    interceptors to clear the air for your own aircraft
-   Strategic Bombardment attacks behind enemy lines, weakening IC and
    province infrastructure of the soon to be retreating forces
-   Tactical Bombers conduct interdiction missions on the enemy lines as
    your main army attacks, helping to rapidly reduce enemy organisation
-   As the retreating enemy falls back into a province with greatly
    reduced infrastructure, your Close Air Support bombers perform
    ground attack missions, tearing the enemy army to shreds.

###  Night Flying 

Night operations have a penalty to attack of -80% and a penalty of -50%
on defense. This effectively makes it safer for bombers to conduct
nighttime bombing runs, and it makes INT and FTR less effective in
combating them during the night. Air Doctrine research gives greater
advantage to the bombers, eventually with the elimination of the defense
penalty entirely. This is essential for effective use of STR in
particular.

##  Aircraft In-depth 

###  Interceptor vs. Fighter 

Interceptors are designed to defeat bombers (STR, TAC, CAS, NAV), while
Fighters are designed to achieve air superiority. For this reason,
fighters will defeat interceptors in an "even" fight, and will perform
decently against enemy bombers. Interceptors, on the other hand, will
severely punish enemy bombers, causing heavy damage and forcing enemy
bombers to abort their mission.

Fighter Overview:

-   Superior Range (necessary in the Pacific)
-   High cost to build
-   High cost and time to repair
-   High supply/fuel needs
-   Technology comes later
-   Decent at non-conventional uses (ground attack, etc)
-   Excellent for JAP and USA due to range issues

Interceptor Overview:

-   +25% combat bonus when fighting bombers
-   Inferior Range (not needed due to defensive role)
-   Low cost to build
-   Low cost and time to repair
-   Low supply/fuel needs
-   Technology comes earlier
-   Very poor at non-conventional uses (ground attack, etc)
-   Rocket interceptors are very poor and need two more aircraft techs
    to be researched before interceptors can upgrade to turbojet models
-   Excellent for GER, USSR, ITA, UK

For these reasons, many players exclusively build Interceptors. A
combined force of Fighters and Interceptors is the most potent
combination possible.

###  Escort Fighters 

Escort Fighters (ESC) are always a necessity for TAC, STR, and NAV since
they significantly reduce the org and strength damage taken by bombers,
which results in improved bomber effectiveness. In HOI2, NAV were
extremely dominant, and did not technically need escort fighters. In
HOI2 DD and ARMA, NAV must have ESC. CAS cannot have escort fighters,
and as a result are more likely to receive more damage in combat.
Historically, it was determined that the most effective bomber/escort
ratio was 1:1, and this remains true in the game. In HOI2, escort
fighters are distinct aircraft units, and thus should be grouped with
bombers. In HOI2 DD and ARMA, escort fighters are aircraft "brigades",
and can be directly attached to bombers.

Carrier Attack Groups (CAG) are the other type of escort fighter in the
game, and function as a naval brigade. A carrier (CV) without a CAG is a
carrier without any aircraft, which of course is a worthless Carrier.
Naturally, all Carriers must use a CAG to be effective. As an added
benefit, as technology upgrades occur in escort fighters, naval CAGs in
port will automatically be upgraded. This effectively serves as a
carrier upgrade, making carriers the only ships in the game that can be
effectively retrofitted.

###  Strategic Bombers 

Strategic Bombers (STR) are only truly effective with Air Superiority
established for a certain region, or when flying at night. STR are very
vulnerable targets and are also expensive and time consuming to repair.
At the same time, STR are generally the only way to achieve air
superiority over enemy territory, with the obvious exception of
capturing enemy provinces. In game terms, capturing provinces is almost
always easier that achieving air superiority.

When STR performs logistical strikes, enemy IC is reduced in the
province. That in turn lowers the target's ability to supply, reinforce,
produce, and upgrade his military. It also lowers his TC, which may
lower the ESE of his troops in the field.

On a naval note, Port Strikes with Strategic aircraft have much the same
effect on enemy naval forces as Runway Cratering missions do with his
air forces. You don't need to sink his ships if they can't be repaired,
refueled, and rearmed. As Great Britain, hitting German ports can be a
major boon to keeping your supply lines open. Your convoys don't have to
worry about submarines that are undersupplied and spending months longer
in port to repair.

###    Tactical & Close Air Support Bombers 

Once you have established air superiority, it is time to use your
Tactical and CAS aircraft to effect. Your use of air is meant for one
thing, and one thing only, winning on the ground.

Ground Attack and Interdiction are your bread and butter in this case.
Use a combination of these attacks for greatest efficiency. TACs are
best at Interdiction and Ground Attacks are best for CAS. Technically,
both are very good at both missions. The increased attack values of CAS
above Basic level combines with shorter flight times and increased
ground attack efficiency to make for truly staggering numbers. And once
an enemy unit breaks and is on the move, Ground Attack missions from CAS
aircraft will severly tear them up. Additionally, the CAS is much more
effective as the war goes on and enemy Softness factors begin to drop.

###  Naval Bombers 

Naval Bombers are highly capable in Naval Strike missions. In fact, NAV
was so powerful in the original HOI2 that many players refused to build
any naval ships, and instead solely built NAV! NAV could utterly
decimate any fleet in the water, without taking any serious damage. As a
result of this extreme imbalance, NAV were weakened in DD and ARMA,
though still quite capable. In addition to Naval Strike, NAV are capable
of convoy bombing. They are not as good as submarines at convoy bombing,
but they are still effective in this dual role.

Naval Bombers (NAV) are fairly unique among other air units, in that air
superiority is considerably less important. This is partly because there
is no AA over sea zones, and ships generally have much weaker AA than
land units, which is historically accurate. Also, it is far more
important for nations to use their air power over their own land units,
rather than patrolling sea zones. Thus, NAV are generally quite free to
roam about the oceans with little interference.

  

##  AirPower Efficiency 

Airpower can be extremely effective, but it is not necessarily the most
efficient use of resources, which is often a focus for veteran HOI2
players. HOI2 has been modeled in such a way that \*the most efficient\*
use of military resources is an Infantry-only army. The IC, time,
supply, and repair costs associated with Infantry beat out any other
type of unit by a large margin, including air units. Also, mastery of
air power is challenging in terms of time, cost, and research. While
many nations can find a particular, effective use of airpower, extremely
few nations can manage to have a presence across the spectrum of air
options.

This being true, Airpower does have specific, unique advantages:

1.  Constancy of Attack - Air power can apply pressure and damage to an
    enemy continuously, while land force must advance. The ability to
    continue to damage the enemy and keep him on his heels when he's
    been knocked back can mean a difference of a lot of IC and manpower
    spent on reinforcement.
2.  Wide Ranging Effect - This applies to the Strategic strategy more so
    than the Tactical strategy, however it is applicable to both. The
    wide ranging effects of damage to IC can be devastating. 8 air
    divisions (4 bombers with 4 escorting fighters) hitting a province
    like Dresden, Cologne, or Berlin with maximum ToT can translate to
    big TC and production losses. TC dropping down reduces ESE of ALL of
    his armies. When a unit hits supply problems, they start getting a
    -.5% combat efficiency loss for each 1% of ESE below 100%. This can
    be very damaging. What other investment of IC can get a combat
    efficiency penalty across all units in an enemy army, navy, and air
    force, REGARDLESS of the size of their army (you might say "easier
    with a bigger army")?
3.  Speed of Response - CAS and TAC aircraft can move across a continent
    faster than any other unit. If the enemy is making an unexpected
    attack, or gaining an unexpected advantage, air power is flexible
    enough to move to the other front and blunt the enemy assault. An
    armored attack can grind to a halt under heavy attack from CAS
    aircraft. Sending an infantry division to reinforce a defense can
    take some time, especially in lower infrastructure areas (can we say
    Russian Steppe, or Africa). Sending in aircraft for the same purpose
    can take an hour or two. An hour can be all the difference in
    winning an losing.

##  Miscellaneous Tips for Using Air Power 

A few other tips before I wrap it up:

1.  Make sure to mark any air unit messages as Show Message Popup and
    Pause. If you do this, you won't forget the aircraft, and once one
    mission is complete, you can go and examine your forces, determine
    their readiness, and get them back up again without missing a beat.
2.  Produce early, produce often - Air divisions are rarely destroyed
    (unless you let them get overrun). Produce them early and upgrade
    them. You can pump out infantry much faster than you can aircraft.
    Get your air forces up to fighting trim before you go to war.
3.  Continue to expand your air force as you go, planning ahead for
    future operations. If you want to keep England out of the war while
    you work on Barbarossa, keep your Luftwaffe expanding so that you
    can maintain the pressure on a crunched England while you deal with
    Stalin on the East Front.
4.  Change your focus as the need becomes apparent. If you've managed to
    achieve air superiority as Great Britain, when D-Day is getting
    closer, go ahead and start working on some CAS aircraft or increase
    your TAC ratio in your air force. Certainly, the CAS won't be as
    effective as the TAC, but they're cheap and they can make a
    difference on the battlefield when your enemy's advantage in
    technology is nullified (An ME 262 on the ground isn't going to do
    much against your older, slower CAS aircraft in the air).
5.  Once You Go Up, There's No Coming Down - Realize that once you
    commit to air power, you're going to have to intentionally lag in
    one area. If you're Germany or the USSR, you won't have the
    resources/time for effective naval investment.
6.  Getting aircraft where you want them - Ground Attack and
    Interdiction missions will be most telling in battle. The targeting
    AI DOES prioritize active combats as targets. However, if your air
    units are in the air when combat starts, they may already be
    targeted, or in the middle of a mission, and won't go where you need
    them. By the time they've returned to base and head back out again,
    chances are the ground combat is nearly over. Use the planning boxes
    to launch your aircraft one to two hours AFTER you begin a ground
    attack. If you win before they arrive, then the enemy will get hit
    on the move for big time results. If the arrive before you win,
    watch the little green bar shrink.
7.  Too Much of a Good Thing? - Yes, there is too much of a good thing.
    Use your air power in moderation. Each division above 2 in one
    combat gives a -2% effectiveness to ALL aircraft in the combat. If
    you have 30 CAS all attacking one target, you're not going to get
    results. Any over your command limit (minimum of 14) are going to be
    fighting immediately at a -25% penalty. Then everyone is going to
    get a -56% penalty for all those aircraft.
8.  Be Mindful of Mother Nature - Weather can be detrimental to all
    military missions, but it is the one thing other than free ranging
    enemy bombers that can GROUND your air forces. While not paying
    attention to the weather with land forces means that you can expect
    a harder time of things, not paying attention with aircraft means
    MAJOR penalties. If you have storms or blizzards in the target area,
    aircraft cannot attack. If you have storms or blizzards over your
    airfield, they can't even take off. Rain and Snow can have a
    detrimental effect, but you can reduce this effect by researching
    the appropriate doctrines for the aircraft type. Attacking at night
    in the rain is pointless. Ground your aircraft and save the oil.
